Only two remaining intact supply lines were available for controlling the event. Cooling of the reactor core was always possible because of the 4x50% design of the emergency and safety sytems. The full power supply was re-established after about 22 minutes through manual switching. Approximately 20 minutes after the initial event, the 500 V diesel bus bars in the affected divisions were manually connceted to the 6 kV system, supplied by the off site auxiliary power, and all electrical systems were thereby operational. The scram of the reactor was successful, all control rods were inserted as expected. Two valves in the pressure relief system opened because of unwarranted initiation of safety trains. The emergency core cooling system in two out of four trains was however more than sufficient to maintain the reactor level above the core, as there were no additional LOCA.

During a past inspection, Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors identified, and Kewaunee later reported, that the Kewaunee plant design for internal flooding events may not mitigate the consequences of non-safety related piping system failures in the turbine building. High water level in the turbine building would result in water flowing into certain Engineered Safety Features (ESF) equipment rooms because ESF rooms are separated from the turbine building by non-water-tight doors and the plant floor drain system. The ESF equipment rooms contain the auxiliary feedwater system (AFW), emergency diesel generators, and both 480 volt and 4160 volt ESF switchgear. The water could reach levels that may result in failure of certain ESF and plant safe shutdown equipment.

Documentation which considers specific flooding events from postulated failures of plant equipment exists; however, a complete internal plant flooding analysis was not developed during or subsequent to the plant's original design. In response to the inadequate plant design, physical changes were made to minimize challenges to plant equipment and personnel in combating potential flooding events. Although an event resulting in actual flooding of any portion of the plant has not occurred, the potential for certain piping and tank failures resulting in unacceptable flooding existed. The licensee completed a past operability evaluation to assess what equipment would have failed during postulated flooding events. The NRC Significance Determination Process assessed the safety consequences and implications for any equipment that would have failed and determined that the condition was characterized as Yellow (i.e., an issue with substantial importance to safety, that will result in additional NRC inspection and potentially other NRC action).

Licensee Event Cause Summary

Design basis documentation regarding flooding, high energy line break, seismic, and tornado protection lacked detail and was difficult to retrieve, and some processes related to maintaining the design basis were weak and were inconsistent with industry standards. The plant staff lacked a thorough knowledge of the design basis and fully effective processes for determining the significance of problems and prioritizing their resolution. The plant staff evaluation and resolution of identified and potential problems lacked rigor. The probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) submitted for Kewaunee's individual plant examination (IPE) was flawed with respect to flooding risk."	PWR	Permanent Shutdown	595	1974		1		1		T	120.0	160.0

A	Under annual shut down, there was an incident of flash over and burning of the power supply cable of one of the process water pumps. This was caused by spurious connection to two independent (redundant) power sources simultaneously caused by faulty control logic.

After the source of fire was identified and isolated, the power supplies and the connected loads were restored, in about 1 hour and 15 minutes. During this period of non-availability of power supply, forced circulation of Primary Heat Transport (PHT) and moderator systems were not available.

Various attempts were made to stabilize the system, but they were unsuccessful. The temperature of the charcoal beds and the vault increased throughout the second day, and finally the air stream was diverted from the vault to a bypass system. A stream of nitrogen was passed through the vault to cool the charcoal and to extinguish a fire if one were present. Subsequent examination revealed that a blocked drain in the air system had prevented the air stream from being preheated prior to entering the recombiner. As a result, the catalyst in the recombiner had become ineffective, and a high concentration of hydrogen passed downstream to the vault; it apparently exploded there and ignited the charcoal beds. The purging of the vault by nitrogen had extinguished the fire. There were no injuries, and there was no release of radioactivity.	BWR	Operational	1155	1976		0		3		T	1.0	10.0

When the plant's emergency coolant-injection system activated twice, the utility declared an alert, the third-highest nuclear emergency. Regulators (NRC) blamed the shutdown on a combination of operator error, poor training, previously identified equipment problems and inadequate direction. The NRC is particularly concerned because communications between senior station managment and the staff have been deficient for some time, and the deficiencies have contributed to a number of prior events. During the eight weeks, Salem 1 was shut down, the utilities were forced to buy replacement power at up to $500,000 (1994USD) a day; utilities are spending $150 million to improve equipment and training, in addition to the $300 million spent since 1990.

Following scram discharge volume (SDV) high level bypass and a short drain period of the SDV, a second manual scram was initiated and all partially inserted rods were observed to drive inward, but 59 remained partially withdrawn. A third manual scram was made, again following high level in the SDV and bypassing for another short drain of the SDV, with the result that 47  rods remained partially withdrawn. Following a longer drain of the SDV, an  automatic scram occurred that was initiated by a scram discharge volume tank  high water level signal when the scram reset switch was placed in ""Normal"";  with this scram all remaining rods fully inserted.

HPI initiated as a result of depressurization through the open PORV, and with approximately 70 percent of NNI inoperable or inaccurate, the operator correctly decided that there was insufficient information available to justify terminating HPI.  Therefore, the pressurizer was pumped solid, one safety valve lifted, and flow through the safety valve was sufficient to rupture the reactor coolant drain tank rupture disk, thereby spilling approximately 43,000 gallons (162,800 liters) of primary water into the containment.

Water and steam poured out of the pressurizer through the stuck open relief valve and filled the drain tank. At 3 minutes the operator realized the situation and closed the block valve; a rupture seal on the drain tank blew, allowing primary water to spill onto the floor of the containment building.

The leak rate increased and led the operator to shutdown the reactor in order to localize the leak before reaching the safety threshold of 230 l/hour. The operator localized a non isolable primary water leak on a piping connecting the safety injection system to the plant primary system, probably due to thermal fatigue. The defected part of the pipe has been replaced during a one month outage.
The damaged pipe length has been examined at the irradiated material workshop at Chinon and the preliminary expertise concluded to a through-wall crack located on a portion of straight piping and not on specific areas such as bends and welds as it could be expected. The most probable hypothesis is that the origin of this crack is due to a thermal fatigue due to a variation of temperature produced by cold water coming from non-tight valves located upstream.
The operator, EDF, decided to make controls on straight parts of the piping during scheduled outages on 900 MW plants and, in some cases, decided specific outages.
Other defects have been found on two pipes at Dampierre 3 in March 1997 and on Fessenheim 2 in April 1997 (so that other portions of pipes have been replaced and will be expertised).
EDF has provided DSIN with a study on the evolution of the phenomenon. It appears that on a particular pipe small non-detectable defects can potentially lead to a through-wall crack within less of a cycle if these defects are initiated and stand small cold leaks from upstream valves.
The analysis of this study by DSIN has led to re-rate the incident level 2.
Still, EDF will give its strategy to solve this problem on the mean term by the end of June. Until the implementation of this strategy EDF will have to proceed to specific additional controls on these pipes."

A loss-of-flow event occurred, initiated by a switchyard transformer explosion, resulting in the loss of Class IV power to Unit 4 and a consequential turbine trip. The Reactor Regulating System responded by initiating a reactor stepback to 60 %FP. The HT pumps tripped because of the loss of Class IV power, significantly reducing the coolant flow through the channels. The resulting increase in heat transport system pressure was sufficient to activate opening of the LRVs, which provided pressure relief via discharge to the shell side of the bleed condenser. The bleed condenser high pressure alarm was activated shortly thereafter. As the HT pumps continued to run down, the measured flow in the SDS channels dropped below 20.5 kg/s, the HTLF setpoint for both SDS1 and SDS2 at reactor powers greater than 70% FP. A SDS1 trip was initiated at this time. Due to instrument sampling time, the SDS2 low flow trip was initiated shortly afterwards.	PHWR	Operational	934	1993		1		2		T	1.0	20.0

These motors should be able to operate under severe environmental conditions (high pressure and temperature) and their tightness is required, according to the original qualification tests, to prevent significant introduction of water and/or steam into the motor casing.

The mechanism for the crack was not yet determined and the potential could not be discountede for similar cracks to occur on Reactor 22 which would be outside the operational safety case. The conservative decision has been taken to affect a controlled shutdown of Reactor 22.
Arising from the discovery a Project Team has been set up under the chairmanship of a company Engineering Division senior manager. The team will have responsibility for managing all aspects of the project including investigation of the causes, additional inspections, repairs and production of the safety case for return to service.
Justification of Rating:
Potential initiator with full safety function availability gives a basic rating upper limit of 2. The guidance then allows for adjustment dependent upon the likelihood that the defect would have led to component failure.
The mechanism of component degradation is not yet fully understood, but the extent of the cracking is such that there appears to be little margin to failure remaining. Additionally, it is clear that the failure of this component was considered in the safety case to be unlikely, and therefore no routine surveillance programmes were in place to monitor the weld.

The investigations undertaken have shown that the valves have been blocked in closed position since the reactor began operating in 1985. As a result of this detection EDF has started a campaign for all other pressurized water reactors to verify the availability of valves of the same type which showed that 30 pressure valves were not operative. These were in circuits classed as ""important for safety"": in the component cooling circuit - and in the case of Gravelines - and in other circuits.
Relating to other anomalies mentioned in Magnuc (information system of the French Nuclear Safety Authority, SCSIN) (anomalies of maintenance, of sand filters, anomalies in the installation of sump filters) which are affecting the quality of installation completion of pressurized water reactors, the Ministers of Industry and the Environment asked EDF to make a special effort to detect such problems. It is by making such an effort that EDF discovered that valves in certain auxiliary circuits were not in the right state to fulfill their function.
It is therfore welcome to encourage the efforts made by EDF and to correct such anomalies; at first these efforts could lead to an increase in the anomalies detected. But on the other hand, it is appropriate to state that the final phase of reactor construction proves yet again that it may conceal some significant errors in the organization of quality control. Upgrading the level of quality control at certain construction sites appears even more indispensable. In the first analysis these anomalies found in the auxiliary systems classed as ""important for safety"" do not seem to have resulted in an important cummulative risk, but it is worrying that there has been lack of compliance with installation methods, with control and quality assurance of the circuits concerned, and this demands deeper analysis."

Subsequently, while controlling the S/G water level, the TBN and reactor were tripped due to the S/G water level high-high signal. The failure of the condenser steam dump valves was due to failed actuation of the condenser steam dump valve (one of three valves in the condenser dump valve group #1). It increased the power deviation between the reactor and the TBN, and opened the 6 valves in the dump valve group #2. Therefore, too much steam was released to condenser, and S/G pressure was relieved. The S/G water level rapidly increased due to the swelling, and it caused TBN trip and actuated feedwater isolation signal. In spite of the activities to supply main feedwater and to recover the water level, the opening of the main feedwater isolation valve was delayed, and subsequently, the reactor tripped owing to S/G water level low-low signal. All the safety parameters were maintained within the allowable range, and there was no impact on the reactor safety.
Besides the failed actuation of pressure balancing valve of the condenser dump valve, it was found to be hard for the operator to predict the plant status correctly and understand the characteristics and functions sufficiently. In other words, the operator could not properly cope with the failed actuation of the dump valve even though recognizing it in advance, and operated the unit without incorporating operating experience that TBN startup should be commenced at above 15% reactor power. 
Condenser steam dump valve was dismantled and inspected, and startup operating procedure was revised to prevent transient at low power.

Upon investigation, it was verified that the main steam line pressure of the Steam Generator(S/G) ‘B’ continuously indicated zero bar(g) even though those of S/G ‘A’ and ‘C’ were increasing when the unit experienced the Main Steam Line High Differential Pressure. Because the isolation valve of the main steam line B pressure transducer was closed, the main steam line pressure of S/G ‘B’ was not being measured. The I&C contractor personnel who carried out the calibration for the S/G pressure transducer on April 18 did not reopen that isolation valve after the calibration, and so the isolation valve of the main steam line B pressure transducer was inadvertently closed. Following the actuation of SI, all the safety-related systems and components were operated as expected and the emergency operating procedure for the spurious safety injection was entered and exited about 5 minutes after the SI actuation. Since the RCS pressure was above the shutoff head of the LHSI(low head safety injection) pump, SI flow into the RCS did not occur.

 16:22 Start RCP #001PO  
 16:26 RCS restored NOP(155bar) and NOT(286℃)  
With an abnormal depressurization condition, the operator intentionally blocked the SI signal  which ought to be done during normal cooldown operation only. Even with RCP #003PO and #002PO stop the RCS depressurization continued. During further depressurization, the operator should have actuated the manual SI when the pressure decreased to the low pressre SI setpoint(118.7bar.g) but the shift crew could not actuate manual SI. And they only considered the fail-opening of spray valve and neglect any other possible accidental condition in the FSAR. 
This was an evident and intentional inappropriate defeat of safety injection.  

When the operator stopped RCP #001PO, the primary system recovered normal pressure and temperature. After recovering the RCS pressure the plant was maintained in hot standby condition and the RCS pressure was maintained at 155 bar.  

Upon investigation, one of the two spray valves was found to be fail-open due to loosening of the travel pin nut which comprised the pneumatic positioner of the spray valve. Thus the travel pin was separated from the assembly which resulted in the actuation of the rotary shaft arm and continuous supply of IA(instrument air) to the valve and this caused the valve to fail-open. During the previous 13th overhaul, the valve positioner was replaced with a new one and the travel pin and nut was reassembled. It was estimated that there were some inferiorities while carrying out the reassembling work.  

There was an unmeasurable and unaccountable loss of safety function associated with this inappropriate defeat of SI and there were a great deficit in the safety culture of the shift operators and the utility.

The operators isolated the affected SG and actuated the safety injection (SI) according to the EOP. The pressurizer level was recovered by the HPSI flow, and the reactor was depressurized and cooled down using the intact SG to terminate the leak flow. At 19:59, the RCS and SG pressures were equalized, and the SI was terminated followed by plant cooling down using SG backfill operation.

After the shutdown, the operator switched it over to operation mode ‘5’ and removed the residual heat through RHRS (Residual Heat Removal System) and S/G. The damage of the NSCW system pipes was appeared to be due to the disconnection of some steel wires caused by the long-term corrosion of the internal cylinder and steel wires, as the pipes were established inside of the concrete gallery that can be easily corroded. The licensee covered the NSCW system with temporary plate for prompt recovery, and replaced the pipes damaged during an overhaul and the neighboring pipes that cracking was detected. Also, in the long term, the licensee determined to strengthen the investigation on the NSCW system pipes and the concrete gallery and to perform minute investigation on the cracking or leakage of the NSCW system pipes every 5 years.

Although the reactor trip breaker was opened at around 11:37, the operator neglected it for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, and overlooked the failed status of trip breaker status light. Also, he did not check the position of the trip breaker. In addition to it, it was confirmed that the management of related regular/periodical test was inappropriate and the inspection on relays were insufficient. To prevent recurrence, the licensee strengthened the inspection procedure on the block relay and complemented the test procedure. Also, he prepared a reactor trip breaker operation procedure and improved the operation procedures for principle components.	PWR	Operational	1012	1989		?		1		H	0.0	0.0

In the course of this activity 2 MSVs out of 12 opened, and the steam was received by the accident isolation system as designed. Partial steam release to environment occurred through the clean air venting facility of the isolation system decay chamber without exceeding permissible limits. Once personnel activated the lines of forced closure, the above two valves closed. Repair of the faulty pressure gauge was performed -  without the established work program, combined with the failure to take technical measures aimed at preventing unauthorized opening of MSVs.

Disconnection of power cables from HPSI pump valve motors was performed on 04.02.91 after unit shutdown in the course of cooldown process to avoid reactor vessel water hammer effect in cold condition at possible unauthorized start of these pumps. However, due to deficiencies in the work and surveillance program and in the design as regards valve position monitoring from the control room, the power supply was incompletely restored and this ocurrence was not discovered during the prestart testing.

At 02:27 and 02:32 turbogenerator 1 and 2 were tripped by system emergency protection as a result of strong frequency oscillations in the system. At 02:32 reactor shutdown upon AZ-1 signal, actuated on core pressure difference increase above setpoint because of increased flowrate of the Reactor Coolant Pumps as a result of grid frequency rise up to. The normal Diesel Generators (DGs) 1,2 and the standby diesel (SD) started for coast down as designed. Since the auxiliary power buses were under voltage, DGs 1,2 tripped after 1.5 mins of operation according to design algorithm. Personnel transferred DGs 1,2 and SD to manual control and auxiliary power was supplied from service transformers. Main steam header pressure maintaining and residual heat removal were performed using turbine bypass check valves (venting steam to condensers) and steam dump valves (controlled bleed to station service collector). Steam generator (SG) levels were nominal. Preparations were started to bring the reactor to the minimum controlled power level. At 03:33 AZ-1 signal was formed again. DGs 1,2 and SD failed to start due to their unavailability for the start-up (they were on manual control). Significant voltage oscillatios at 6 kV auxiliary buses subsequently followed. By 04:00 the primary cause of the AZ-1 scram signal was eliminated; DGs 1,2 and SD were brought to automatic control. At 04:11 at voltage decrease AZ-1 signal was formed on Reactor Protection System (RPS) feeders deenergization. DGs 1,2 and SD started. DGs 1,2 failed to get connected to essential buses since the latter were under voltage and after 1.5 mins of operating tripped. Since the AZ-1 signal for DGs start persisted, DGs 1,2 periodic restarts followed which led to exhausting the air inventory in the DGs startup air bottles. Core cooling was maintained through natural circulation. The SD remained in service at coast down but at 04:26 was tripped by the oil pressure protection. Subsequent attempts to supply power to auxiliary buses from the DGs were unsuccessful due to absence of air in the startup bottles. At 06:15 as a result of system accident progression total loss of power occurred. DGs 1,2 and SD failed to start due to insufficient air pressure in the DG startup air bottles. The vital buses were connected via the reversible motor generators to the batteries. Core cooldown was performed via SGs in the natural circulation mode with steam dumping. At 06:45 unit power supply from the off-site source was restored. Throughout the transient core status was being monitored with the help of design-provided (normal) instrumentation.

A short circuit occurred in the armature winding of the reversible motor generator (RMG-1) connected to the unit DC panel (UDCP-1). Automatic breaker which disconnects UDCP-1 from RMG-1 failed to open. The resulting current oscillations have led to the opening of the automatic breaker which supplies power to Reactor Protection System (RPS) emergency protections panels from UDCP-1. The automatic breaker of the same panels fed from the common unit DC panel opened on unexplained cause. Because of loss of voltage on the RPS panel AZ-1 protection actuated and the reactor was scrammed. The signal for diesel generators (DG) start was generated. The prestart oil circulation pumps (POCP) of these diesels fed from UDCP-1 started. Because of the total short circuit current in RMG-1 generator and the load current including the POCP starting currents, the automatic breaker connecting UDCP-1 to the battery opened. The automatic breaker feeding UDCP from RMG-1 was opened manually. As a result of UDCP deenergization operating DC supply to control circuits of some mechanisms without standby sypply from other DC panels was lost. This resulted in the failure to start two service DGs and one standby DG, loss of remote control function of safety injection pumps, emergency feedwater pumps, SG safety valve and normal operation systems mechanisms. 20 mins later the power to UDCP-1 was supplied through the mutual redundancy grid from the common unit DC panel.

A	An earthquake of magnitude 9.1 occurred off the western coast of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean and generated a transoceanic tsunami which devastated the coastline, with a maximum runup of 50.9 m on the northwest coast of Sumatra. When the tsunami struck the plant in India, the condenser cooling pumps were affected due to flooding of the pump house and subsequent submerging of the seawater pumps. Following this, the reactor tripped automatically and the reactor was brought to cold shutdown using the emergency operating procedure. The pump house operating floor is located about 2.5 m above mean sea level, about 2m below the level of the main plant buildings, and is connected by a submarine tunnel about half a kilometre long to the intake well. The increase in water level in the pump house during the tsunami rendered all the seawater pumps located in this area inoperable except for one process seawater pump. This pump was used to cool the NPP’s loads in the initial period following reactor shutdown. Later, this pump also became unserviceable due to clogging of the travelling water screen in the seawater pump house due to the ingress of large quantities of debris from the tsunami. Though off-site power remained available throughout the event, emergency diesel generators were started and were kept running as a precautionary measure. The plant declared an emergency alert at 10:25 on 26 December 2004, which was lifted at 21:43 on 27 December 2004. The tsunami did not affect Unit 2, which was under long shut down. After restoration of the affected areas, the unit was restarted on 1 January 2005. This event showed that external flooding (in particular from tsunamis) can lead to the loss of the ultimate heat sink and create further common cause failures if the flooding level is above the design basis flood. Moreover, it showed that external events can affect simultaneously several units at the same site, and can bring additional issues when the infrastructure is destroyed.

Meanwhile, the effectiveness of core cooling by natural circulation decreased sharply for about a 3 hour period. After switching over the natural circulation among the llps, the operating personnel isolated loops 4 and 6 and started to drain them. Nitrogen used to drain the water got into the loops in operation and most of the water was pushed from the SG primary side into the reactor vessel. The operator tried to stop disturbance of natural circulation by starting periodically the make-up pump to the working loops. During this injection the personnel performed venting several times to take away the gas-air mixture from the top of SG headers, Eventually, restoration of natural circulation was achieved by continuous venting of the SG headers.

During the inspection, it was discovered that the header had severe erosion/corrosion damage. Through wall holes in the header were found at the tee connection, and the sleeve connection at the shroud was displaced and damaged. Consequently, a decision was made to inspect the headers in all boilers and similar damage was found in each boiler. The headers in all boilers were removed and replaced with an erosion/corrosion resistant material. It was subsequently assessed that the boilers were fit for service as no other damage affecting structural integrity was observed. The defective headers were assessed as not being related to the boiler level indication anomalies. Following completion of this work the reactor was returned to operation.

After completion of the maintenance for the ex-core  detector, the plant restarted the heat-up operation controlling the reactor coolant temperature utilizing  the shutdown cooling system; the plant was on mode 4 with the RCS pressure and temperature was  28kg/cm2 and 145℃, respectively. Both the shutdown cooling system and the containment spray system  share the shutdown heat exchanger and are separated by the heat exchanger outlet isolation valve (CSV033)  and the containment spray isolation valve (CS-V035). CS-V033 was opened and CS-V035 was  closed when the incident occurred. 
On September 17, at 14:17, the CS-V035 opened inadvertently due to a human error, and reactor  coolant was sprayed into the containment through the containment spray system. The RCS experienced  a severe transient; the pressure was decreased rapidly from 28kg/cm2 to 3.9kg/cm2  and the temperature  and water level were lowered quickly. 
Rapid decrease of RCS pressure and water level was identified by the MCR operators, and the  operators carried out responsive actions in accordance with the emergency operating procedure (EOP)  including stop of reactor coolant pumps (RCPs), isolation of the letdown line, and increasing the charging flow. Also, additional safety measures were taken; manual actuation of the safety injection to recover the RCS inventory, and manual actuation of containment isolation to prevent radioactive material release to the environment. 
After taking a series of initial responses, MCR operators identified that the containment spray isolation valve (CS-V035) was abnormally opened; the valve was manually closed at 14:54 and the plant entered into stable condition. The result of analyses based on the changes of refueling water tank  (RWT) level and RCS inventory showed that the amount of the sprayed water (or borated water) to the containment was 423 tons. 
During the event progression, major plant safety systems including the emergency diesel generator (EDG) and containment purge isolation were actuated as designed. As a result of the event, most of the Structures, Systems, Components (SSCs) inside the containment were affected by the sprayed borated water; especially the reactor cavity and the containment floor level were flooded. 
As the operating parameters such as leakage rate of reactor coolant was within the emergency issuance condition, the plant declared emergency (Alert level) at 15:00, and cleared at 18:00 after confirming the plant operating conditions. "	PWR	Operational	1044	2010	"Root Causes and Corrective Actions 

Inadvertent opening of CS-V035 occurred due to the human error mixed with (1) MCR operator's 
mishandling of the CS-V035 hand-switch and (2) test engineer's local equipment manipulation without 
approval of the MCR, which directly caused the spray of borated water to the containment. 
In detail, acknowledging that the thermal overload relay tested on the previous day was not reset after 
the test, test engineer pressed the “RESET” button installed at the local breaker to make it clear possible 
and it led to the opening of CS-V035 which already had erroneous opening signal by MCR operator’s 
mishandling of the CS-V035 hand-switch. 
Though there were some design changes for the containment spray system compared to the reference 
plant (Ulchin Unit 5 and 6 of Korea), those were not reflected into the operating procedure; the 
shutdown heat exchanger outlet isolation valve (CS-V033), the up-stream of CS-V035, (which should 
be closed during the heat-up operation) had been opened, which contributed to the event occurrence as 
one of the root causes. 
Additionally, inappropriate organization attitude toward plant commissioning was also another causal 
factor "	?		1		H	50.0	70.0

The setpoint was too low so that, when the diesel generator was supplying the 380 V board, the protection tripped on high voltage de-energizing power supply to safety related equipments. At the same time, it was discovered that the low voltage setpoint was not adjusted as by the design specification and that it was not possible to reach the right value due to construction features of the protection relay.

At the impulsion side of train B an immediate drop of pressure was detected after the pump was started up, what led the crew to stop the pump and proceed to investigate the event. After checking it locally, a break was found in the hatch neck , located in a small chest after the pumps building. After reparation and restoring operability of train B, plant personnel proceeded to inspect train A of the ESW. Similar loss of thickness due to corrosion was found at the same hatch neck as the repaired one in train B and similar reparation was conducted in train A. The remaining hatch necks showed thickness within the engineering margins, although some of them presented corrosion points. Afterwards, it has been revealed that the utility was aware of the degradation of train A almost simultaneously to the degradation of train B since 1993 but maintenance activities had not been improved. In year 2000 no measures were taken after an inspection report had recommended an measure of the thickness of the affected hatch neck. May, the 10th 2004 percolated dampness was identified and the utility did not declare the correspondent “non-compliance” status of the plant.

The switchyard breaker was opened inadvertently due to spurious actuation of the ‘reverse power relay (32A relay)’. In response to the LOV, the Standby Diesel Generator (SDG) #2 started up automatically and the safety related equipments loaded from the SDG were actuated automatically and successfully as designed. However, the SDG #1 did not started up because it was under maintenance. The safety grade-4 power (13.8 kV) could be restored by closing the Power Circuit Breaker (PCB) 7300, 33 minutes after the LOV while implementing the Emergency Operating Procedure-015 (Loss of Grade-4 Power). 
Upon investigation, the reverse power relay was found to be actuated due to several factors such as 1) unanticipated performance of the circuit containing the protective relay (78 relay, out-of-stop relay) and the reverse power relay, 2) the plant operator’s failure to confirm the plant initial condition for surveillance and 3) improper process control for the annual overhaul work. After the LOV which continued 17 seconds for the train-B and 33 minutes for the train- A, the SDG #2 automatically actuated and it supplied power to the train-B and the train-A power was restored by closing the PCB 7300. 
While restoring the LOV condition and implementing the EOP, there was no problem with the safety function and the plant was maintained in the guaranteed shutdown condition. 
Causes and Corrective Actions 
During the reconstruction test, it was found that an unanticipated 190 mV voltage for 78Ry and 108 mA current for 32A was generated in the circuit (Fig. 2) by opening and closing the ‘knife switch’ during measurement of the CT insulation resistance. And the unanticipated generatedcurrent again caused the protective relay (32A) to actuate of which the setpoint was 45 mA. According to the overhaul schedule, while performing the CT surveillance test, the PCB 7300 should be in open position, the main transformer should be in shutdown mode and the link (generator output breaker) should be disconnected from the generator. However, the PCB 7300 was in closed position and the main transformer was pressurized during the surveillance test. Accordingly, this event was attributed to spurious actuating of the 32A relay which the operators couldn’t anticipated and the improper process control for the maintenance work. 
The following corrective actions were implemented. 
- Revised the related surveillance and maintenance procedures 
- Improved the process control for the overhaul work 
- Planed to improve the Out-of-Stop Relay (long-term plan) 

Safety Assessment 

Safety related variables i.e., the reactor header inlet/outlet temperatures, the moderator outlet temperature, the component cooling water (CCW) temperature and the spent fuel pool temperatures were checked in depth. And the reactor coolant system (RCS) subcooling was identified to be maintained, the CCW temperature was found to be increased from 25 ℃ to 34 ℃ which was below the limit value, 38 ℃. There was no adverse effect on the plant safety or radioactive material release to the environment as a result of this event."	PHWR	Operational	655	1997		?		3		T	0.0	0.0

Upon investigation, the sequence of box-up event was like this; a fault sprinkler nozzle of the D/G room adjacent to the ""secondary control area(SCA)"" discharged water, the sprinkled water penetrated inside the panel of the SCA and the water penetration into the SCA panel caused a spurious signal. As a result of the sprinkler nozzle failure in the #2 D/G room and the sprinkled water, the radiation monitoring panel, the #2 D/G panel and other panels in the SCA were partially submerged. The utility implemented a replacement of the damaged components with spare parts(radiation monitoring panel), integrity inspection(SCA panels) and disassembly inspection for the #2 D/G. The reactor containment box-up signal from the SCA panel is different from the reactor trip signal and do not cause subsequent reactor trip or power reduction. Confirming the integrities of components and proper measures for the box-up signal, the box-up was cleared at 7:33 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005. During the box-up event, all plant safety systems operated as expected and there was no radiation release to the site nor to the environment."	PHWR	Operational	682	1982		0		1		T	0.0	1.0

Heavy water in PHTS was released to the degasser condenser. The reactor automatically tripped on pressurizer low level about two minutes later. The turbine runback was initiated, and the operator manually tripped the turbine. Degasser condenser pressure control spray valves and level control valves were closed as designed. PHTS pressure recovered and stabilized with one liquid relief valve open. Operator action was focused on keeping the coolant inventory in the pressurizer and the feed pump suction head by pumping heavy water from the supply tank to the storage tank, while maintenance crew investigated the cause of the problem and the possibility of repairing the damaged liquid relief valve. The cooldown and the depressurization was not performed by the operator immediately. Degasser condenser pressure was built up due to heavy water inflow through the small line connected to the feed water pump discharge. This caused both degasser condenser relief valves to open and heavy water to spill onto the floor sump. Steaming of hot water caused reactor building isolation on reactor building pressure high signal for a few minutes. The operator cooled down the reactor and depressurized PHTS. During the event about 6.5 tonnes of heavy water were spilled. There was no notable radiation exposure and radioactivity release to the environment.	PHWR	Operational	682	1982	"INES 2 probably due to spill of radioactive heavy water to the sump floor and delayed operator action (the degasser condenser relief valves opening resulted from the operator's delayed-action for plant cooldown and depressurization) 
 
The root cause of the reactor trip was the crack of a diaphragm of the liquid relief valve and the cause of heavy water spillage to the sump floor through the degasser condenser relief valves was the operator's delayed- action for plant cooldown and depressurization. The following actions were taken after this event : - Reviewed and reestablished diaphragm replacement programs for all air operated valves. - Revised emergency operating procedures corresponding to liquid relief valve failures in order to prevent the degasser condenser relief valve from lifting. This includes early decisions regarding PHTS cooldown and depressurization."	1		1		T;H	4.0	6.0

The pump was tested and requalified according to the technical specifications but the curve (flow-rate pressure) was not verified as required by ASME-XI. The actual flow rate delivered in case of specific accidents could no longer match the flow rate postulated in the safety report. Nevertheless, an independent emergency feedwater system could offer additional capacity in such circumstances. This anomaly was discovered on 18 march 2011 during a test which was suggested by the authorities.	PWR	Operational	1090	1985	degradation of a safety function	?		1		H	0.0	0.0

While testing for the load rejection signal, the main turbine incremented its speed and main turbine control valves started to close. When the pressure at the first step started to decrease until 4.6 kg/cm2, there was a main turbine trip signal due to the actuation of the Speed Acceleration Limiter, but this signal trip did not actuate the Reactor Primary System (RPS), instead there was a reactor trip due to high pressure signal of the reactor pressure vessel. The cause was that the during the power rising process after testing of the Moisture Separator Reheaters the alarms associated to the bypass of the signal trip for the main turbine trip were not reestablished, therefore the during approximately 40 minutes the reactor operated without this reactor trip signal.

Instead of being throttled, they were closed. The correct position of the valves would have been critical in requesting the emergency system to cool one of the two main pumps and the associated pump room.

Supervisor directed manually overriding High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) immediately prior to a manual scram during a plant transient; the potential consequence of overriding HPCI is, in the potential event of a small break loss of coolant accident, that operations would not be able to maintain adequate core cooling; no radiation impact.","1":"A manual reactor scram was initiated in response to a loss of Reactor Closed Cooling (RCC) due to the opening of a service water valve at the inlet side of the fuel pool cooling heat exchanger during faulty performance of a partial surveillance. The loss of RCC resulted in a loss of cooling to several components, including the reactor recirculation pumps; all plant systems responded as designed.","2":"The reactor was running at full power when the first leakage of steam was detected visually on remotely operated cameras; later as pressure rose in the containment a plant emergency was immediately declared; all safety systems worked well, the reactor was shut down and radioactivity confined in the reactor  building.","3":"Both divisions of the Residual Heat Removal System were declared inoperable for Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) mode due to a failure of the division 1 LPCI outboard injection valve to open after properly closing during an operability surveillance test.","4":"The plant was ascending in power when screenwell water level started to lower caused by frazil ice blockage at the intake structure. At 89 percent power, at 22:23, operators began taking compensatory measures to reduce power and mitigate water level lowering; 17 minutes later a manual scram was initiated, complicated by a residual transfer that resulted in non-vital equipment trips and finally led to manual actuation of some safety-related systems.","5":"A pipe carrying steam from the reactor to the turbine-generator cracked in the turbine hall, releasing radioactive steam and forcing an evacuation of the facility after the reactor was manually scrammed.","6":"Automatic reactor trip due to a turbine-generator trip as a result of a fault on 345 kV feeder of a transmission tower, apparently  caused by bird streaming; all control rods inserted and required safety systems functioned properly.","7":"An explosion\/fire occurred at a transformer was extinguished by personnel. The reactor was shutdown and not in danger.","8":"Staff at Pickering Nuclear discovered the incorrect blocking and locking of a valve that is part of the guaranteed shutdown system.","9":"The plant was on the way from hot standby to cold shutdown mode, operating with one main feedwater pump when the the pump speed unexpectedly lowered to zero. After manual trip of the pump the water level in the steam generators decreased and the Manual Auxiliary Feedwater System was actuated.","10":"During restart after turbine trip a combination of operator errors caused shutdown of two steam isolation valves followed by a system response as designed including reactor trip; restart the following day","11":"Unexpected opening of a secondary system valve resulted in an atmospheric steam release; reactor shutdown, steam generator remained undamaged.","12":"A steam leak in the turbine building forced the reactor to shut down until repairs could be made. The plant was brought back online and synchronized with the local power grid three days later.","13":"A transformer failed, causing the automated shutdown of the reactor. All control rods fully - inserted and all required safety systems functioned properly. A fire that resulted from the failure was extinguished, and the reactor was placed in a safe and stable condition. The failed transformer contained about 24,000 gallons of dielectric fluid, which is used as an insulator and coolant when the transformer is energized. The U.S. Coast Guard estimates that about 3,000 gallons of dielectric fluid entered the river following the failure.","14":"Reactor Trip Resulting from a Phase to Phase Fault on the 1E Main Power Transformer, caused by design vulnerability where ice falls from one component onto another.","15":"Both trains of the Reactor Protection System and DC electrical distribution system inoperable due to inadvertent parallel connection of both trains of these systems during refueling outage.","16":"The plant underwent a storm-induced unplanned shutdown after the two 345 kV lines that provide off-site power tripped subsequently; a third off-site power line remained available, the emergency diesel generators were started successfully by way of precaution and the reactor was in safe shutdown condition. However, due to additional equipment failures, the regulator initiated special inspection.","17":"During surveillance test of one emergency diesel generator (EDG), a non-licensed operator erroneously adjusted the other EDG governor setting. Both EDGs were declared inoperable, although a subsequent evaluation determined that at least one EDG was always capable of performing its safety function.","18":"Disconnection of the plant from the power grid due to a failure of the electrical equipment in the turbine hall; restart 12\/3\/2014.","19":"As announced by the vendor, efficiency in loss of coolant accident analysis codes adversely affected predicted peak cladding temperature (2513 in excess of 2200 F); due to sufficient margins no impact on current operation and safety.","20":"During planned maintenance, a valve on the moderator system opened inside the reactor building. The leak was contained within the building and there was no impact to station staff, the public or the environment.","21":"Manual reactor trip due to a storm induced heavy influx of dune grass and debris from Lake Michigan causing degraded forebay condition.","22":"Visual inspection revealed holes in the fuel feed tanks of the emergency diesel generators; potential water intrusion could have rendered diesels inoperable.","23":"Delayed identification of steam generator tube leakage.","24":"Unexpected cracking in the boiler spine of unit 1 at Heysham A forced an 8 week shutdown of four reactors in the Heysham A and Hartlepool sites; no direct safety impact.","25":"Reactor scram on high neutron flux followed by a \"Group I containment isolation\". One inboard isolation valve showed dual indication rather than fully closed. Troubleshooting determined a valve stem-disk separation which allowed the main disk to drop into the main steam flow path; the resulting pressure transient added positive reactivity which caused the high neutron flux scram.","26":"Detection of a few boreholes through the steel wall of the primary containment without seriously impacting its integrity and retention capability.","27":"Dual unit reactor trip on loss of offsite power which occured in the main switchyard; all systems including the emergency diesel generators functioned as designed.","28":"A scheduled refueling outage was extended after 15 to 17 broken-off bolt heads from a cooling pump were found in the reactor vessel. Returned to service on July 11, 2014.","29":"Internal flooding in the non-nuclear part of the reactor had damaged the safety electrical systems, leading to shutdown of reactor. The repair and requalification of the equipment affected by splashing water lasted nearly 50 days before the reactor was restarted.","30":"Reactor tripped when a non-safety-related 13 kV service bus de-energized due to a ground fault on feeder breaker caused by inadequate protection against weather (snow storm) related water intrusion. The loss of the service bus caused the loss of circulating pumps and main condenser vacuum, requiring the use of auxiliary feedwater and atmospheric dump valves. Power was also lost to a safety-related bus which caused the start of the pertinent emergency diesel generator.","31":"Unit taken offline due to a transformer fire in the site switchyard. The fire was contained without injuries or threats to safety.","32":"Discovery of three broken, and a few leaking, damaged fuel rods during unloading and fuel inspections, one additional pin broke during transfer; restarted expected at end of Nov. 2013.","33":"False blockage of a checkvalve in one of the four trains of the decay heat removal system and concurrent clearing of another train for maintenance lead to temporary unavailability of the system to cope with external events.","34":"Manual shut down after slightly radioactive water leaked out of from a valve in the rector coolant system and went through the plant's drain system as designed. The spill was confined to the plant's containment building; no risk to workers or the public, and regulators have said there was no risk to the public.","35":"Typhoon Soulik caused a generator and turbine trip, left seawater inlet blocked, damaged five filters and a traveling filter valve; reactor automatically shut down after manual power reduction failed; lengthy repairs.","36":"Control room operators used an annunciator response procedure to address the loss of startup power. Contrary to technical specifications they made all three Unit 1 emergency diesel generators (EDG) inoperable for almost two minutes when they placed all EDG switches into manual control; all offsite and onsite power sources were operable.","37":"Loose blade of the air damper fell onto the bus bar isolator between generator and main transformer and triggered automatic plant shutdown; no direct safety impact; resumed operation after a few (?) hours.","38":"In refueling state the unit breakers of the 400kV incoming off site supply received an unintentional order to open, but only two out of three phases opened, causing low but still over 65% voltage in the rotation; no emergency diesel got start order; safety-grade components with phase imbalance protection were disconnected, due to over-heating; operability of grid supply and safety system re-established after 30 and 90 min, respectively; no off site consequences.","39":"High Pressure Safety Injection (HPSI) System pump flow imbalance existing since commissioningl, as HPSI system flow and record loop injection valve positions was not adequately translated into design documents. Under worst case accident conditions, the HPSI system flow rates to the RCS loops could have been imbalanced resulting in less than 75% of the minimum required HPSI flow being injected into the reactor vessel, resulting in fuel overheating and damage.","40":"A small fire broke out in the turbine hall while the reactor  was being brought back into service. The fire was caused by an oil leak, and ignited lagging surrounding part of the turbine. The reactor was shut down and cooled, mitigating any threat of nuclear contamination. Emergency services attended the fire from stations across the  area and the fire was extinguished after roughly 35 minutes.","41":"Lightning struck led to phase-to-ground faults resulting in an opening of the main switchyard and loss of offsite power and reactor scrams on both units. All emergency diesel generators started and loaded the respective busses, all control rods fully inserted and all systems responded as expected.","42":"The cause of the high pressure core injection system (HPCI) inoperability was a failure of a bellows actuated pressure switch which resulted in a significant turbine oil system leak. The apparent cause of the pressure switch bellows failure was corrosion fatigue. The potential safety consequence of this event is significant since the oil leak was of sufficient magnitude to have caused a loss of HPCI system injection capability during a design basis accident. however the reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system and low pressure emergency core cooling systems (ECCS) remained operable during the period when the HPCI system was rendered operable; the affected pressure switch is calibrated on a 6-year frequency.\nThere is no preventive maintenance task that performs periodic replacement of the switch. The failed switch had been in service since initial plant operation.","43":"In response to the discovery that bends were found in water rods at Unit 5 at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa (event on 16.10.2012), inspection of fuel assemblies was conducted for all units, and it was confirmed that some fuel rods touched each other in Unit 1.","44":"A fire broke out in a lube oil purification system in the Pickering Nuclear Unit 1 turbine hall. One of the three heating elements in the heater for the purification system remained energized when its associated switch was in the \u201coff\u201d Position. The fire caused extensive damage to the turbine lube oil purification skid and overhead cable trays, as well as ancillary damage to a nearby hydrogen system panel. Damage to the overhead cable trays led to 45 additional days of outage work for replacement","45":"Both units were at risk of external flooding inundating the Unanalyzed Essential Raw Cooling Water pumping station through inadequate electrical conduit penetration seals that could allow flood waters to enter into the system at a rate greater than the installed sump pump capacity and impact system performance during a (hypothetical) flood event above plant grade.","46":"The primary sea defence (a shingle bank) was not as robust as previously thought. An investigation was initiated and the reactor had to shutdown whilst an improvement program was implemented.","47":"Operator found that an incorrect control rod (less instead of more absorbative) had been loaded in March 2003. The misload was identified during routine control rod maintenance after their removal from the reactor.","48":"Leak on an auxiliary line of the reactor's coolant system, when entering the final restart phase, after planned shutdown; leak contained in the reactor building, and stopped by applying reactor cold shutdown instructions after 5 hours; no consequences for the staff nor the environment.","49":"Fast-acting gate valve in the chilled water system switched-off for planned repair, and left open despite of regulations.","50":"The operator, after completion of Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) monthly test, by mistake, initiated the ECCS during reactor cold shutdown state. The heavy water injection to Primary Heat Transport (PHT) system did not terminate as per logic and this led to entry of nitrogen gas into the PHT system. As a result of nitrogen ingress, core cooling flow in some of the coolant channels was disturbed. The operator immediately took corrective action to degas the PHT system and for restoration of normal flow through the core.","51":"Oil fire started in the reactor building and was extinguished rapidly; the reactor was then automatically shutdown; abnormal water leak from a joint on the primary circuit, collected by dedicated circuits\/tanks; incidental procedures; no impact on environment.","52":"The reactor automatically shutdown following an electrical fault on the non nuclear side of the plant. One and a half weeks later it was restarted at half capacity with one turbine in operation.","53":"Potential failure of emergency diesel generators due to faster deterioration of pads to reduce friction between moving parts of diesel engines (detected before at another station).","54":"Small primary-to-secondary leak in one of the two steam generators; the leak was isolated and the reactor was rendered to cold shutdown conditions in accordance with plant procedures. The AIT report, 1 issued July 18, 2012, identified design control issues associated with the thermal-hydraulic modeling of the steam generators as the probable cause of the steam generator tube degradation that ultimately led to the tube leak in Unit 3.  \u201c baseline core damage frequency of a steam generator tube rupture, according to the SONGS SPAR model, is 4.26E-7\/yr\u201d. Subsequent investigations revealed premature wear on the steam generators of both reactors; 17 months later it was decided to decommission both units\n","55":"Transformer and breaker failures cause loss of offsite power, reactor trip, and de-energized safety buses. The key issue for this event is the potential for operators to fail to recognize this scenario.","56":"Station blackout, during cold shutdown state, occurred when workers made a mistake that led to a disconnection of grid power supply, and a standby back up diesel generator failed to start automatically, another generator was out of service for maintenance and a third was available for manual start; reconnection to the grid within 12 min; slight increase of core and used fuel pond temperatures.","57":"Absence of a siphon-breaker orifice on the fuel storage pools of the two units during inspection; potential inadvertent operations including extraction of water from the pool.","58":"Seven-hour emergency imposed after heavy water leaked from a feeder pipe to the reactor, during routine maintenance shut down; no damage or radiation; plant restart after 4-5 weeks.","59":"Reactor automatically shutdown and four back-up diesel generators started, when the plant lost off site power due to a beyond design basis earthquake; coincided with the Unit 1 turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pump being out-of-service because of testing; one EDG suffered a coolant leak and stopped working, but was replaced by a fifth one; off site power was restored on the same day.","60":"The failure of a safety-grade electrical breaker and subsequent fire resulted in a large quantity of soot and smoke and impacted some safety-grade equipment; the resulted in a loss of spent fuel pool cooling function and if the reactor would have been at power, loss of a safety function or failures in systems used to mitigate an event could have occured.","61":"During refueling operation a pair of spent fuel bundle got detached from its end plates resulting in separation of fuel pins from the fuel bundle. The event occurred due to a mechanical fault in fuel transfer system, used for transferring spent fuel from reactor building to spent fuel storage bay. The fuel pin of the spent fuel bundle got damaged during the fuel transfer operation, as was evident from the minor release of iodine and fission product noble gas through the stack at the time of the event.","62":"All three reactors scrammed due to loss of external power caused by a tornado in the vicinity of the plant. Control rod insertion and cooling procedures operated as designed with no physical damage or release of radiation. Emergency diesel generators (EDGs) provided power after a brief period of outage. An Unusual Event, the lowest level of emergency classification, was declared by NRC due to loss of power exceeding 15 minutes. Additionally, a small oil leak was found on one EDG; one EDG of unit 3 was out of service due to maintenance.","63":"Unit experienced a brief partial loss of power, while performing start up activities. Automatic systems restored the power; the operating staff responded according to procedure.","64":"A beyond design 9.0-9.2 seaquake and a 14-14.5m tsunami caused total loss of AC\/DC power due to flooding; subsequent loss of core cooling; hydrogen explosions; high release due to deliberate containment venting; 20km exclusion zone; 150'000 people continuously displaced; discharge of radioactive coolant water into the sea; all units given up; excessive clean up.","65":"Following the Tohoku earthquake, a fire broke out in the turbine building; reactor shutdown and power supply by back up diesel generators, that failed after a certain runtime, but were repaired to cool down the reactor without any damage.","66":"An explosion occurred in second main transformer, resulting in an automatic reactor trip and spilling oil into the Hudson River; no safeguard equipment damaged.","67":"An electrical feeder cable failure to 4 kV non-vital bus 5 caused an arc flash and fire. Non-isolation from bus 4 due to a failure of the breaker to open resulted in reduced voltage to one of the reactor coolant pumps and in a reactor trip; subsequently an automatic safety injection occured due to reactor cooldown. During plant restoration the crew made mistakes and caused a second fire.","68":"There was a fire in a lubrication system for one of the water pumps that feeds water for generation of steam. Reactor power automatically lowered to 68% due to the reduction in feed water flow, and the fire was extinguished in less than three hours.","69":"The reactor was safely shutdown after a small leak (5 liters\/minute) was detected, subsequently traced to the bottom of the pressurizer; due to a fault within one of 78  heater elements, a tube developed cracking such that there was a water path into the containment building. The plant was taken offline for 6 months because of difficult repairs.","70":"Vegetation in the river Rhone, after heavy rain, blocked the water intake of the cooling system, forcing reactor shutdown, and triggering internal emergency plan; no damage or release.","71":"A fire occurred in the boiler annexe area and forced the shutdown of the affected reactor. Separately, during significant safety assessment work the licensee identified cables in the boiler anexes of both reactors (21 and 22 (on periodic shutdown)) that were insufficiently protected against hot gas release.","72":"A fuel assembly got caught on the upper internal structures during discharge operations; evacuation and isolation of the reactor building; under water cooling according to normal shutdown procedures.","73":"A crack developed in the discharge accumulator of the reactor's feed pump forced the reactor to be shutdown for extended repairs, restart after one year.","74":"Complete loss of offsite power to the two essential 4 kV bus transformers for about 49 seconds due to lightning strike on a nearby substation, resulting in a turbine trip and subsequent reactor trip sinc all reactor coolant pumps tripped on under-frequency.","75":"After a switching procedure from a system to a unit auxiliary transformer, one reactor coolant pump tripped unexpectedly due to over-current which resulted in a reactor trip and subsequently in a turbine generator trip that caused transformers to become de-energized, which in turn caused remaining three reactor coolant pumps to trip off due to loss of power to their busses. Following this \"loss of offsite power situation\" emergency diesels were started and loaded the safety related busses and allowed the auxiliary feedwater pumps to be operated. Since some non-safety-related equipment was not available, the operators used a \"feed&bleed\" mode of pumping water into the steam generator and removing the steam through relief valves to the atmosphere. After more than half a day the reactor coolant pressure was low enough to place the residual heat removal system in the shut down cooling mode.","76":"Loss of offsite power due to a lightning strike and caused short circuits, resulted in opening of generator output breakers, fast closure of turbine control valve and, finally,  reactor scram. De-energization of the safety-related 4 kV busses caused a pressure increase of the reactor coolant system (RCS), controlled by opening of electromatic relief valves, followed by initiation of both isolation condensers. The main feed pumps, powered from non-safety-related busses, tripped while both emergency diesel generators started and allowed the operators to start the second control rod drive pump to feed cooling water into the RCS to restore the reactor pressure vessel water level. The short interruption of power for the reactor protection system caused primary and secondary containment isolations, including closure of the main steam isolation valves. Besides unsuccessful attempts to early restore offsite power to all safety-related buses and placing the emergency diesel in a standby status, the response to this event was basically as designed.","77":"Partial loss of offsite power after loss of Common Station Service Transformer results in dual-unit reactor trips and extended loss of offsite power to a safety bus in each unit; all four emergency diesel generators automatically started and systems functioned as designed; reactor coolant system temperatures were controlled by steam generator atmospheric relief valves.","78":"An inadequate design of the cooling water flange of the emergency diesel generator (EDG) B resulted in a cooling water leak during a routine test and operators secured the affected EDG without completing the test.","79":"Failure to prevent inadvertent, uncontrolled control rod withdrawal by non-licensed operators during maintenance activities.","80":"Emergency diesel genenator B output breaker tripping under full load conditions during monthly surveillance test","81":"Main turbine and generator were damaged by severe turbine vibrations caused by broken low-pressure turbine blades. Reactor manually tripped and all major safety systems functioned as designed. Fire caused by leaking hydrogen, extinguished after roughly 20 minutes; \"unusual event\" terminated after about 8 hours.","82":"A cable fault tripped the transformer which supplied power to the site. This resulted in a loss of off-site power to some plant equipment and other equipment problems in safety-related systems; the plant was automatically shut down.","83":"Maintenance operations revealed that one out of two fans, for the management of air, was not functioning, due to incomplete replacement of the electrical control device; no direct safety relevance.","84":"Leakage between containment and lining identified by a pressure test at the end of start up process after revision, caused by permutation of circuit points in measuring lines after replacement.","85":"On reentry after the 2008 revision deadline, two safety-relevant rectifiers had failed. The plant continued its approach after the disturbance had been rectified, although the cause of the double failure was not known. Thus, it has violated a central principle of safety. In addition, the G\u00f6sgen NPP reported the incident to ENSI only in March 2009.","86":"Safe shut down of plant after a primary circuit leak was detected, and coolant spilled into the containment; no damage to the core, no release to the environment; repair within days.","87":"One instrumented relief valve (IRV) of the primary heat transport (PHT) system opened spuriously due to the failure of its actuator diaphragm. This resulted in hot PHT coolant entry to bleed condenser (BCD) and automatic reactor trip on 'PHT system pressure very low'. Automatic start of standby pressurizing pump but on observing rise in BCD pressure, operator manually stopped that pump and all the four running primary circulating pumps in contravention of operating procedures. Finally emergency core cooling system (ECCS) injected heavy water as PHT pressure dropped below set point, etc. (see ref. for further mechanisms). Emergency was declared and lifted after normalizing the plant status roughly 4 hours later.","88":"Both reactors were tripped from 100% power when both channels of the safety-related 4 kV bus undervoltage relays actuated, following a momentary grid voltage disturbance. Concurrently, the unit 4 (non safety-related) C bus de-energized and tripped the 4B steam generator feed pump. Auxiliary feedwater pumps started on both units when the steam generator narrow levels dropped below 10%. Offsite electrical power remained available to implement Emergency Operating Procedures and emergency diesel generators did not auto start because of the short duration of the grid voltage disturbance. Thus, the plant response was as designed with one minor complication, the inadvertent actuation of the auxiliary feedwater system on unit 4.","89":"There was a combined unavailability of emergency diesel generators.","90":"Short circuit occurred during maintenance work at Brunsb\u00fcttel; grid connection failed; disconnected from the grid and manually shut down; fire in the turbine building, cracks detected in pipe coverings. 30 minutes of electricity supply interruptions in the Hamburg area effecting traffic lights and all underground trains. Reconnected to grid on 1 July. \n\nBrunsb\u00fcttel may have triggered (grid-facilitated trip) short circuit in transformer at Krummel, resulting in burning transformer oil. Fire controlled. Failure of the internal power supply; Reactor manually shut down.  Expert inspection found that one of the pumps which supply water to the reactor had shut down unexpectedly, and two safety and relief valves had opened accidentally. The result was that the water level and the pressure in the reactor fell quickly. Balanced by switching on a reserve supply system. Operational data missing ; police investigation for violation of procedure ; intense political criticism of information handling. Restart June 2009.\n\nContext: Germany's long-running ideological battle over the planned phasing out of nuclear energy by 2020.\nAfter the 2007 accidents in Kruemmel (and Brunsbuettel, which is still off-line) the company lost already some 250,000 customers in Northern-Germany.\n\nFollowing market deregulation and a higher retail churn--coupled with the nuclear outages at two of Vattenfall's German reactors--Vattenfall lost about 250, 000 customers in Germany in 2007.\n\nSpent \u20ac300 million ($420 million) upgrading the plant post 2007 incident.

The cause of the event was attributed to deficient design of electrical system that resulted in common mode failure of control power supply.","93":"The power station was shut down as part of standard emergency procedure when at 9:40am a fire broke out on one of the generator transformer HV bushings. No-one was injured in the fire and no radiation was released. Information suggests an insulator overheated, causing it to fail. All emergency procedures were commenced, and by 11:30am the situation was stabilised. The power station resumed production for a few days in June then shut down again.","94":"Identified leakage of the containment during refilling with nitrogen after revision due to false positioning of two valves controling the personal access lock.","95":"An automatic reactor trip (RT) occurred due to a turbine-generator trip as a result of a fault on the 31 main transformer. All control rods fully inserted and all required safety systems functioned properly.","96":"Opening of 8 out of 16 safety blow-off valves due to faulty implementation of instructions. Release of large amounts of steam into the pressure suppression pool lead to decreasing water level in the reactor pressure vessel and automatic reactor scram; plant response largely as designed.","97":"Placing of anchor bolts to fix safety relevant systems not according to specifications during backfitting measures at both units.","98":"Due to work being inappropriately carried (outside core building)  out a short circuit occurred which led to a separation of the plant from the high voltage grid, which in turn caused an unexpectedly high voltage spike and the loss of two of the four trains of the emergency power supply as well as to the loss of houseload power supply. Only two remaining intact supply lines were available for controlling the event. Cooling of the reactor core was always possible because of the 4x50% design of the emergency and safety sytems. The full power supply was re-established after about 22 minutes through manual switching. Approximately 20 minutes after the initial event, the 500 V diesel bus bars in the affected divisions were manually connceted to the 6 kV system, supplied by the off site auxiliary power, and all electrical systems were thereby operational. The scram of the reactor was successful, all control rods were inserted as expected. Two valves in the pressure relief system opened because of unwarranted initiation of safety trains. The emergency core cooling system in two out of four trains was however more than sufficient to maintain the reactor level above the core, as there were no additional LOCA. The control room staff had difficulties in supervising the plant properly during the event as many indications and readings were lost due to the loss of power in two trains.","99":"Two of the three instrumented relief valves (IRVs) of the primary heat transport (PHT) system opened inadvertently during unit operation, automatically tripping the reactor on PHT System Low Pressure. The operators closed the IRVs manually. The cause of the event was attributed to earth faults since wrong wiring connections remained unnoticed. There was no external heavy water leak during the event.","100":"During reactor operation, an auxiliary feed water line (10% flow) to one of the steam generators (SGs) inside the secondary containment of reactor building ruptured. This resulted in loss of water inventory from condensate and feed  water system and consequently in low water levels in the SG.","101":"During shutting down for refueling, the plant's turbine control system malfunctioned, finally scraming the reactor; all control rods were inserted within 4 min and all safety system including the ECCS  functioned well.","102":"An ill-conceived surveillance of the tertiary cooling water intake canal led to its significant silting up; the collapse of the sand hill could have led to the heat sink loss of all four reactors.","103":"Water escaped pipes feeding the secondary circuit of the reactor by drain valves that were unusually open. The water seeped into the building, leading to insulation faults on electrical equipment of the reactor protection system . These defects caused the automatic shutdown of the reactor and the decommissioning of two of the four sensors which measure the reactor power.","104":"Sub-standard of the secondary coolant pump power supply cabling lead to a fire in an electricity funnel; one out of two safety circuits had to be disconnected, triggering local internal emergency plan.","105":"Reaktorschnellabschaltung auf Grund des \u00d6ffnens von Sicherheitsabblaseventilen\nDas der Stufe INES 1 zugeordnete Vorkommnis ereignete sich am 6.

In der zweiten Phase wurde der Druck im Reaktordruckbeh\u00e4lter\nstabilisiert, gefolgt vom Abk\u00fchlen der Anlage.","106":"Millstone plant safely shut down without incident when a computer circuit card signaled an unsafe drop in pressure in the reactor's steam system, e.g., due to a steam line break, when in reality there was no drop in steam pressure; the cause was attributed to \"tin whiskers\".","107":"During the year 2006 the operator has noticed the presence of provisional pieces of equipment on both of the reactor protection control command lines. These pieces were applied during the previous reactor outage and had been left there by mistake. Under accidental conditions certain automatic sequences would not have taken place in a normal way.","108":"Some of the 60 control rods in the reactor appeared not functioning; when operators tried to activate one cluster of control rods to lower reactor capacity by 30%,  after one-out-of four main cooling pumps became disconnected; three out of the six rods remained stuck; remaining clusters were tested after run down of the reactor by pumping boric acid, resulting in a total of 22-out-of-60 rods appeared not functioning, maybe due to inadequate testing after safety upgrades.","109":"Due to design flaw the safe shutdown of the reactor could have been jeopardized had an internal flooding occurred; rector remained offline for four months while this and other design issures were being addressed. During a past inspection, Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors identified, and Kewaunee later reported, that the Kewaunee plant design for internal flooding events may not mitigate the consequences of non-safety related piping system failures in the turbine building. High water level in the turbine building would result in water flowing into certain Engineered Safety Features (ESF) equipment rooms because ESF rooms are separated from the turbine building by non-water-tight doors and the plant floor drain system. The ESF equipment rooms contain the auxiliary feedwater system (AFW), emergency diesel generators, and both 480 volt and 4160 volt ESF switchgear. The water could reach levels that may result in failure of certain ESF and plant safe shutdown equipment.\n\nDocumentation which considers specific flooding events from postulated failures of plant equipment exists; however, a complete internal plant flooding analysis was not developed during or subsequent to the plant's original design. In response to the inadequate plant design, physical changes were made to minimize challenges to plant equipment and personnel in combating potential flooding events. Although an event resulting in actual flooding of any portion of the plant has not occurred, the potential for certain piping and tank failures resulting in unacceptable flooding existed. The licensee completed a past operability evaluation to assess what equipment would have failed during postulated flooding events. The NRC Significance Determination Process assessed the safety consequences and implications for any equipment that would have failed and determined that the condition was characterized as Yellow (i.e., an issue with substantial importance to safety, that will result in additional NRC inspection and potentially other NRC action).\n\nLicensee Event Cause Summary\n\nDesign basis documentation regarding flooding, high energy line break, seismic, and tornado protection lacked detail and was difficult to retrieve, and some processes related to maintaining the design basis were weak and were inconsistent with industry standards. The plant staff lacked a thorough knowledge of the design basis and fully effective processes for determining the significance of problems and prioritizing their resolution. The plant staff evaluation and resolution of identified and potential problems lacked rigor. The probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) submitted for Kewaunee's individual plant examination (IPE) was flawed with respect to flooding risk.","110":"Turbine and reactor shutdown after a short circuit in a below ground cable of the own station power supply system probably due to aging of the PVC-isolation; switch to offsite power supply as pre-selected.","111":"Five workers died, and six workers were injured, due to a leak in a pipe in the turbine hall, that resulted in the release of 270C steam;  substantial loss of reactor coolant levels, forcing the plant to immediately shut down.","112":"Radioactivity entered into the secondary circuit via deionized water system that fed into the steam generator because of a missing check valve. Very minor activity release to the atmosphere.","113":"An event of reactor power rise took place during refuelling of a coolant channel. The reactor regulating system rods were not in position to compensate for positive reactivity addition due to refuelling. Operator further raised the reactor demand power, which prevented the addition of boron poison to the reactor.","114":"A ground fault in the electrical grid resulted in losses of offsite power to all three units at Palo Verde. With the exception of one EDG in Unit 2, all EDGs started and loaded onto engineered safeguard buses.","115":"Deviation of boron concentration in the (nuclear) poisoning system from specification, identified during inspection, active over years of operation.","116":"ECCS nitrogen gas accumulator got slightly depressurised during monthly surveillance testing. This accumulator is used for light water injection under pressure to the PHT system during loss of coolant accident. ECCS accumulator remained depressurised for three hours while the unit was operating. This resulted in deviation from technical specifications of the plant.","117":"During unit start up, subsequent to partial loss of class IV power supply failure, reactor was tripped manually. The event was rated at level 1 on INES, as there was a procedural deficiency, which allowed reactor to remain operational under 2 % full power without an automatic trip.","118":"During surveillance testing, one of the redundant valves of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) was found not operating. It was not possible to rectify the valve during unit operation; since this was not in accordance with technical specifications, the plant management was directed to shutdown the unit and rectify the problem.","119":"Shutdown of the plant due to increased activity level of the reactor coolant resulting from leakiness of a fuel rod and hence in the air of the drywell. To allow accessibility of the drywell for inspection and repair the ventilation system was switched to operational modes, i.e., exhaust air via activated carbon filter, open isolation flaps between the drywell and containment, only allowed under cold shutdown conditions. During restart these flaps must be switched to closed which was falsely not done and was against technical specifications; slightly increased release of iodine (2% of weekly emission limit). Subsequent analysis revealed that during the switching over of the afterheat removal system to emergency standby mode, 3-4 cubic meters of reactor coolant unexpectedly flowed backward into the pressure suppression pool which contributed to the iodine release.","120":"Stepwise replacement of fuel elements by new designs caused a change of the moderator temperature reactivity coefficient which became finally positive at temperatures below 140 celsius. When making the reactor critical at 50 celcius, the reactor behaved in a way which the operating staff was not experienced and trained, leading to a  core heat-up rate above allowed level but did not cause harm to the reactor pressure vessel.","121":"Deactivation of torque switches of two mounting drives due to hitherto undetected failures of the vendor.","122":"Generic anomaly. Insulation faults of electrical cables within the reactor building, which could prevent the operation of safety relevant equipment in some accident conditions. 44 reactors affected.","123":"An insulation default at an electrical switchboard was triggered by a steam leak close to electrical equipment that was to be qualified to resist accidental conditions; the non-conformity of the cabling has been subsequently identified on all of the French NPPs and led to large-scale verification and remediation operations","124":"Operating at a power level of 70 % full power, an unintended reactor power increase took place. Prior to the event, while carrying out certain maintenance work, power supply to all the adjuster rods of the reactor regulating system failed and the regulating rods became inoperable. Further, operator inhibited the automatic liquid poison addition system to prevent addition of the boron poison to the moderator which could have arrested the reactor power rise. The reactor power rise could not be arrested by the regulating system and reactor tripped at a power level of 98 % full power. The reactor trip settings were corresponding to 90 % full power as against the operating power level of 70% full power. The incident reflected weakness in plant safety culture and highlighted the need to improve safety practices further.","125":"Deviations from technical specification identified during maintenance for fasteners (pins missing) of pumps of safety-related systems foreseen to transfer horizontal loads from external events such as earthquakes.","126":"A Slammer worm penetrated a private computer network, although protected by a firewall, and disabled the safety monitoring system for nearly 5 hours; the breach did not pose a safety hazard as the plant has been offline since Feb 2002 and was equipped with a redundant analog backup.","127":"Foreign substances (cleaning paper) found during revision of check valves of the fast reactor shudown system in several check valves and some other elements and also in the mechanical part of one control rod drive, left by a contracted company after the 2002 revision.","128":"Under annual shut down, during in-service inspection of coolant channel, leak occurred in coolant channel. About six tons of heavy water escaped from primary heat transport system. A plant emergency was declared at 1140 h. The leak was brought under control by various steps taken by the operators and the plant emergency was terminated at 1225 h. The leakage of heavy water from the channel was stopped completely by 2100 h.","129":"Damage of cladding during cleaning of fuel elements; escape of radioactive gas forced workers to escape from reactor hall; minor atmospheric release; capacity reduced, returned to full power after 2005.","130":"A fire in the main transformer resulted in an automatic reactor shutdown; release of cooling oil to lake Michigan.","131":"The reactor was in hot shut down mode when a \"wrongly scheduled test\" caused the pressurizer relief valve to open, so that the primary coolant pressure dropped to about 85 bars, triggering a number of safety systems which started injecting water into the primary system. Due to communication problems it took 3 minutes to get the key action done, i.e. to close the valve and stop the leak. No environmental impact.","132":"Further deviations in the control of emergency and decay heat removal system following the analysis of simulator results","133":"Incomplete opening of various armatures to limit reactor pressure on demand and additional case of loss of preferred power, identified during inspection.","134":"Identification of deviations regarding protective functions in case of loss of preferred power during test of new simulator.","135":"False mounting of burst disc provided to allow for redundant exhaust of annular space between safety vessel and reactor building.","136":"During major planned repairs at the reactor block, 241 used - and thus practically defective - ball-type flow meters were installed in the reactor instead of new ones.  To conceal the fact that these flow meters had already been used, 231 of 241 were put through decontamination and electro-chemical polishing in the chemical service shop. These operations rendered the sensitive devices unsuitable for use. After the repairs, during restart, the defective meters started to fail, resulting in a loss of control over the water flow in the fuel assembly channels, creating preconditions for a nuclear accident.","137":"The sudden and extensive failure of a gas circulator in May 2002 was thought, from forensic evidence, to be linked to the development of an unexpected fatigue related crack in part of the impeller. In August, another gas circulator on the other unit showed signs of increasing vibration and was promptly shut down by the operators. Its subsequent disassembly revealed a fully developed fatigue related crack in a similar position to the first failure, but the prompt shutdown had prevented consequential damage.","138":"Failure to open of the burst disc of the annular space after spurious start of exhaust ventilator during revision work.","139":"Identification (during test of new simulator) of a design flaw in the control system of the emergency power supply, and emergency and decay heat removal system.","140":"Faulty handling and positioning of a fuel element during inspection caused by a technical failure in the loading machine and subsequent human error; no loss of leak tightness of the two affected fuel elements.","141":"Faulty opening of several power switches in one out of six 0.4 kV emergency power busses during periodic testing causing loss of that train of the emergency power supply system of insignificant safety relevance.","142":"After removal of a new fuel assembly from a buffer store tube, the fuelling machine inserted the short shield plug and was then jacked up. Upon trying to move away fom the standpipe, the machine showed signs of stalling and a bang was heard. Refuelling was immediately suspended and the investigations have since shown that the grab had not disengaged from the short shield plug due to failure of a drive coupling on the grab disengage drive. At the time when the machine had tried to move away, part of the short shield plug became separated and dropped into the buffer store tube.","143":"Plant staff discovered that borated coolant water had leaked from a cracked control rod drive mechanism, directly above the reactor, and eaten through the pressure vessel head, leaving only 9.5mm of stainless steel cladding holding back the high pressure (17 MPa) reactor coolant. A breach most likely would have resulted in a massive loss of coolant accident, resulting in a jet that might have damaged adjacent control rod drive mechanisms; the resulting safety reviews, repairs and upgrades took 2 years (upon which they placed a downtime cost of $600 million); the operator first energy was fined $33 million. [s03]","144":"Starting with an error of maintenance workers, while replacing electrical components on one electrical panel; manual restart of the faulty system, finally resulting in a situation where batteries were the only power source left to one of the two instrumentation and control systems; reactor shutdown; failure of the cooling system of primary pump seals and prevention of switch over to backup system; start of an extra backup system and manual restart after its shutdown by overload protective system; restoration of power supply of failed system after some hours,  but occurrence of additional equipment failures, and hydrogen leak from the generator; restart on 1\/30 after major repair.","145":"Oxyhydrogen explosion caused damage to a small pipe of an auxiliary system used to cool the reactor pressure vessel head during shutdown; continuous full power operation until early inspection; one year plant shutdown for safety checks and upgrades.","146":"The end-fitting blank for one of the coolant channels (G-17) developed a leak due to larger bore diameter than specified. The reactor was immediately shut down. About 1.4 tonnes of heavy water leaked from the Primary Heat Transport System, mostly recovered using the mopping system available in the plant. Minor exposure of employee, and releases within specified limits.","147":"Under annual shut down, there was an incident of flash over and burning of the power supply cable of one of the process water pumps. This was caused by spurious connection to two independent (redundant) power sources simultaneously caused by faulty control logic. This resulted in complete loss of power to the emergency power supply buses. All the loads connected to these buses, became unavailable. After the source of fire was identified and isolated, the power supplies and the connected loads were restored, in about 1 hour and 15 minutes. During this period of non-availability of power supply, forced circulation of Primary Heat Transport (PHT) and moderator systems were not available. Due to this, the temperature of these systems increased marginally by about 5 Celcius. The reactor had been shut down for about 24 days before this incident.","148":"Restart of reactor after refueling with boron concentration below prescribed value in two out of four refilled flooding tanks; unauthorized reactor operation for one month; no danger for the public according to investigations.","149":"The reactor was shut down to investigate high accumulations of water in the containment, confirmed by analysis to be primary coolant leakage; the leak had been suspected as coming from an instrumentation seal but discovered to have been escaping from the seal between the RPV and its head. The investigations by the licensee led to improvements in Foreign Material Exclusion and actions to take upon discovery of water in the containment.","150":"During the dismounting of a lifting crane, it fell on the trestle with cables passed from 330\/6kV transformers to unit 4 (under construction). Due to the resulting earth fault, outside 300kV transmission lines were cut off by electrical protection actuation lines; there was a loss of normal and emergency power supply leading to decreasing frequency of the power supply of the main coolant pumps and actuation of emergency protection including scramming of units 2 & 3. Because of overload the central alarm indication system was disabled that caused difficulties in the event management by the personel. The earth fault caused high currents, burning of the cables, and the following fire spread to 6 kV distribution buses. The fire was extinguished after 1 1\/2 hours; the plant was kept under hot standby condition and restarted after permission.","151":"During reloading, an error in the charging order occured, due to human and organizational faults, which could have led to a criticality risk.","152":"Seasonal smog, containing salt deposits, caused malfunction of all four 345 kV transmission lines and loss of offsite power at Maanshan 1; reactor in hot standby condition; both emergency diesel generations failed to operate; auxiliary feedwater system properly operating by turbine driven pump; restoration of essential power supply by successfully connected swing emergency diesel generator after two hours; reactor in safe condition, no radiation release.","153":"During start up, failure of pressure control system of Primary Heat Transport system caused the system to get over-pressurized; this resulted in the opening of the relief valves.","154":"During a routine monthly surveillance test, the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) and the associated logic got spuriously actuated. This caused the closure of the Reactor Building Ventilation dampers. On resetting the ECCS, two out of four dampers did not open automatically due to faulty logic relay. After repair, the dampers were checked to be working normally and the system was normalised.","155":"The unit was in a shut down condition with Pressurized Heat Transport (PHT) system in a cold and depressurised state. It was noticed that heavy water was leaking from a coolant channel due to a defective seal plug. During this incident, two tonnes of heavy water leaked out of the system. A modified temporary blank was inserted to arrest the leak.","156":"After refuelling a coolant channel, the empty fuelling machine during its downward movement hit the bottom shield, and was incapacitated. This could have been a serious incident if the fuelling machine were carrying radioactive spent fuel. The root cause of this incident was a procedural lapse; a safety interlock, which was temporarily made ineffective prior to refuelling for solving another problem, was not normalized.","157":"The technical specifications require that both auxiliary boiler feed pumps (ABFP) should be available during start-up. However, in one instance, the unit was started up when one of the ABFP was under maintenance. This amounted to a violation of technical specifications; the pump was made operable a day after the start-up.","158":"A sharp drop in coolant flow in a fuel assembly channel, caused by a piece of rubber that had been forgotten during repairs, while bringing the reactor to the minimum controlled power level. The personnel's attempts to restore the flow rate were not successful. The reactor had to be shut down.","159":"Steam generator tube failure resulted in an initial primary-to-secondary leak of reactor coolant with a minor radioactivity release to the environment; manual reactor shutdown and steam generator isolation; during plant cooldown an excessive cooldown rate was inadvertently established, and to restore the coolant level in the pressurizer, borated water was added using the safety injection system. Inspection revealed that the licensee did not perform adequate examination of the (4x3 3000) steam generator tubes during its '97 outage.","160":"An unexpected combination of the tide and high winds partially flooded the site with units 1,2,4 operating and unit 3 shut down for refueling; all units lost their 225 kV power supply and units 2 and 4 also lost their 400kV power supply, leading to automatic shutdown after failure of self supply and triggered start of diesel backup generators; damage to safety related systems; inadequate emergency response: restoration of 400kV power supply after less than 3 hours; no damage to the reactors but the event raised concern about similar threats in other plants in France, and caused upgrades of design rules and protection.","161":"Primary coolant water that leaked (50 tons) from cracks (first 4.4 cm long, second 8 cm long and more) in a pipe of the chemical and control system, made of stainless steel. Highest radiation level, 11,500 times the limit, was measured in a room on the second level basement. The operator believed that metal fatigue, caused by repeated stress, resulted in those cracks.","162":"During regular inspection 3 out of 89 control rods slipped from their normal positions, which triggered a fission chain reaction, and a state of criticality for about 15 min; due to erroneous manual to test actuator ability to move the control rods; nitrogen gas for inserting control rods during an emergency was not ready; workers eventually managed to insert control rods manually into the core. The operator tried to hide the accident, but when it was revealed it forced a 2 year shutdown while investigations were being carried out.","163":"Polyamide cages, non-qualified for accidental situations, instead of metal cages have been built onto ball bearings of coolant safety injection pumps. First identified at the Tricastin site, the problem turned out to be spread over all of EDF's nuclear power plants.","164":"Severe weather conditions over a 24 h period progressively disabled all grid supplies to the site. With fourth (final) line lost (0:23) both reactors manually tripped and post trip cooling established automatically. Emergency diesel generators (EDG) placed on standby after grid supplies reinstated two hours later. When all grid supplies were lost for a second time (11:05), many difficulties experienced including non fully reset of the reactor shut down sequencing equipment, manual reconfiguration required for essential electrical system, etc. Finally natural circulation cooling established on R3 at 11:35 and on R4 at 13:05; at 14:05 forced circulation cooling established on both units, supplied via EDG, grid supplies restored shortly after. On-site emergency stood down by 22:02.","165":"Struck by a tornado the plant's switchyard was damaged and access to offsite power was disabled; the reactor was automatically shut down and electricity for safety systems was provided by emergency diesel generators until external power could be restored; no activity release.","166":"Manual switching of one out of three main steam bypass stations (Frischdampfumleitstation) caused rapid decline of level in tank for turbine oil supply, subsequent turbine shut down and reactor scram. Investigations identified a clogged oil strainer and non-opening of one main steam blow-off\/control valve due to valves in the hydraulic servo line, left closed after a previous plant outage. Plant reaction as designed\/safety ensured as remaining redundant safety-related equipment of the main steam cycles were  functional.","167":"The reactor had been stopped for 5 days when 180 mm pipe rupture in an auxiliary cooling circuit occured which stayed in contact with the primary circuit. The leak\/cracks,  caused by design fault, led to the release of radioactive coolant (steam) into the reactor building; the decay heat removal system remained in operation. Urgent repair effectuated after 5 hours; major redesign and back fit of all reactors of same N4 type.","168":"Detection of a systemic design failure in the reactor safety (control) system, affecting the high pressure injection system, during a simulator exercise.","169":"Operator faced problems with ice condenser containment system, and declared both containments inoperable; plant shutdown for 3 years.","170":"Failure of two out of four pumps of the auxiliary cooling system, located in the same room, because of flooding following a water leakage from the defective bearing of one pump.","171":"Review of diagrams identified an interlock of the feed-in armature that may affect the functionality control of the core flooding system and was regarded as deviation from specification.","172":"Service water system showed declining performance trends spanning two years; event raised doubts whether it could fulfill its safety mission; both units shut down for 2 years to fix the problem, no direct reactor safety relevance.","173":"Degradation of a seal and one of the reactor recirculation pumps failed, causing the reactor to be shut down; plant was ready to be restarted  by August when electrical breaks failed and demonstrated inadequate preventive measures; shut down for nearly two years.","174":"Innocuous balance-of-plant equipment problem mushroomed when inspections identified other equipment problems stemming from same process flaws; shutdown for all of 1997; no direct reactor safety relevance.","175":"All eight reactors at the Pickering nuclear stations were shut down to repair a backup valve on the Emergency Core Cooling System. The flaw was detected on April 15th, and the system had been tested one month earlier. Hydro did not advise the public of this situation until April 20th.","176":"About 500 tonnes of water spilled into the reactor building when employees working on an Emergency Water Supply valve failed to isolate it from the system. An investigation revealed that safety equipment could have failed due to water damage, and both the primary and backup heat sinks were actually lost for a section of the reactor core. The accident blew a 60 lb. valve component 6 feet into the air, almost hitting a worker and shot water up to the reactor building dome.","177":"Two technicians carried out work on the wrong reactor (reactor 5 instead of reactor 6), disabling the second fast shutdown system on reactor 5, which was operating at full power at the time.","178":"Plunging water levels around the nuclear fuel in the core prompted a shut down of the reactor after inadequate, non-timely handling of sealing problems with one and snapping shut of the second feedwater valve; high pressured safety systems kicked in; restart about 8 months later.","179":"Manual shutdown following discovery of a potential common-mode failure that could disable both trains of high-pressure safety injection system, i.e. throttle valves could become clogged with debris; extended outage until mid May, 1999 due to resolution of numerous deficiencies.","180":"Operators manually tripped the plant from 80% power after frazil ice blocked intake travelling screens and trash racks, and hindered water intake on the circulating service water intake systems; emergency service water system was started but misaligned and the standby circulating water train was put in service; the blockage was removed by sparging with air.","181":"After manual shutdown ventilation supply system fans for the electrical switchgear room were declared inoperable; restart by April, 1998, after resolution of numerous deficiencies and replacement of steam generator tubes.","182":"Steam generator tubes with crack indications were identified during forced outage and needed to be repaired; restart about one year later. On Dec 6 1996 operators manually shut down the unit after multiple safety systems found to be degraded.

This apparently caused the valve to close, causing a pressure transient. A 10-inch-diameter extraction steam pipe ruptured, allowing steam to envelop an electronics cabinet in the area, which in turn caused a reactor trip signal based on false indications of generator voltage problems. Voluntarily shut down of both units to inspect all piping sections of unit 1, as found broken a day before on unit 2; additional cracking found; repair and resolution of other equipment problems, restart of unit 2 late '93, unit 1 spring '94.","194":"Voluntarily shutdown of to address problems with the anticipated transient without scram mitigation system actuation circuity (AMSAC); identified deficiencies and design errors, extended restart to 2.3 years.","195":"Turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pumps failed when tested, placing the unit in limiting conditions for operation; manual reactor shut down; list of items to be completed prior to restart 1.1 years later.","196":"Inaccurate signals of the reactor protection and control system due to coupling of electromagnetic impulses into one train of the redundant system of high safety relevance, during search for earth connections.

Staff spent two days trying to stabilize the reactor core before shutting it down, and were later criticized by the authority (AECB) for not shutting it down immediately.","209":"At about 9:20 a.m., a truck backed into a support column for the feeder line in the low voltage switchyard, suppying power to one the reserve auxiliary transformers (RAT), each of unit 1 and 2, resulting in a pertinent loss of power. The associated unit 2 emergency diesel generator (EDG) started and loaded the deenergized vital bus. However due to another electrical fault the turbine and reactor were tripped -  without any complication. Both (crosstied) vital buses of unit 1 were deenergized an the available EDG startet but shut down automatically after 1.5 minutes; loss of all vital ac power for more than 15 minutes with subsequent shut down of operating reactor heat removal pump, while the standby pump could not be started.

Analysis of the emergency shutdown and core cooling showed that the reactor was sufficiently cooled; radiochemical analysis did not reveal damage of fuel elements; after recisions of rules for the design of emergency electric supply (physical and functional separation) and pertinent repairs the plant was restarted in Sept. 1982, and permanently shutdown in 2\/1989.[a137]","246":"Rupture of one of 1640 pressure pipes at 9.6m from the top, due to insufficient flow of coolant; nearby graphite blocks were washed out by water\/steam, fuel was sucked into the rupture hole; contamination of reactor building and release of radioactive aerosols through ventilation stock; plant was restarted after repair","247":"While operating at 95% power, a 4-square-foot rupture occurred in a small diameter elbow in a feedwater heat extraction line. The reactor was manually tripped, a steam jet destroyed a non-safety-related load center and certain non-safety-related instrumentation; personnel were hospitalized overnight with steam burns.","248":"Small steam generator tube leak allowed (radioactive) primary coolant water into the secondary circuit; water found leaking through steam generator shell onto the containment floor due to cracks in the girth weld area; repair works and damage to the main generator after first restart forced plant down for about 1.2 years.","249":"(IGSCC) Plant was shut down after cracks were found in two sections of the reactor's twenty-eight-inch diameter recirculation piping; piping replaced; returned to service in 6\/1983.","250":"A 2,900 liters per minute leak developed in steam generator (SG) B caused by foreign parts that fell onto the tubesheet outside the periphery of the tube bundle during earlier modification works. The operators began a power reduction at 1.5 minutes, at 3 minutes the reactor was automatically shutdown and all three safety injection pumps and followed by start of the auxiliary feed pumps started after main feed water isolation; at 5 minutes all the main steam dump valves were in closed condition and the initial reactor coolant system depressurization stopped. At 15 minutes the defective steam generator was isolated and plant cooldown was continuing by natural circulation in loop A and dumping steam from SG A to the main condenser during the first two hours. Following a set of highly complicated actions and system responses including steam relief from SG A to atmosphere; at roughly 21 1\/2 hours the residual heat removal system was placed in operation. Minor release of radioactivity.","251":"Large amounts of cold feedwater were added to the reactor vessel, causing a power transient controlled by insertion of control rods; the utilized geometry resulted in increased power peaking and fuel failures resulting in air ejector activity to rise to 0.3 Ci per second.","252":"Voluntarily shut down after futile steps taken to limit steam generator tube degradation rate; replacement of all six steam generators, unit 3 down 210 days (in 1981), unit 4 down 183 days (in 1982)","253":"A malfunctioning cooling system fused fuel elements together at the reactor and ruined the fuel assembly that forced an extended shutdown for 2.5 years. [a93]","254":"A 510 liters per minute leak developed in steam generator B, due excessive residual stresses caused by ovalization of the tubing during fabrication. Despite operator efforts to control the primary system pressure and pressurizer level, automatic high pressure safety injection began at about 19 minutes and caused the pressurizer to become filled with water. The auxiliary feedwater flow to both steam generators automatically started at 41 minutes and then the flow to the defective steam generator was stopped 9 minutes later. The residual heat removal system began operation at 3 1\/4 hours. The operators were generally successful in keeping a sufficiently high degree of subcooling in the primary system by shutting down the loop B main coolant pump (a source of heat) and controlling the pressure. No release.","255":"Failure in the secondary circuit; reactor scram followed pressure increase in the primary system; a relief valve opened but stuck falsely open; without adequate information from the staff, finally the reactor was starved of coolant, resulting in a severe meltdown and troublesome phenomena; some radioactive gas released, no injuries or adverse health effects, loss of plant; cleanup from 1980 to 1993.","256":"Voluntarily shut down to replace tube bundles in steam generators after degradation had been evident for at least four years; restart by August '80 with three repaired steam generators.","257":"A short circuit caused a fire in the shared turbine hall, causing collapse of the roof, and damaging oil storage tanks; the intensified fire destroyed measuring lines and cables; subsequent loss of coolant supply and reactor control; fire extinction a few hours later; avoidance of meltdown of reactor cores, overexposure of 8 workers when establishing emergency cooling. [a137]","258":"Hydrogen gas explosion damaged three buildings and forced shutdown of reactor.","259":"Reactor shut down because of a disruption in the feedwater system; this caused a pressure increase in the primary circuit and the opening of the pilot-operated relief valve (PORV) for the pressurizer which falsely stuck open.","260":"Startup sequence was begun and over the following 2-day period, problems developed in the off-gas stream filtering system, the concentration of hydrogen became greater than its combustible limit. Various attempts were made to stabilize the system, but they were unsuccessful. The temperature of the charcoal beds and the vault increased throughout the second day, and finally the air stream was diverted from the vault to a bypass system. A stream of nitrogen was passed through the vault to cool the charcoal and to extinguish a fire if one were present. Subsequent examination revealed that a blocked drain in the air system had prevented the air stream from being preheated prior to entering the recombiner. As a result, the catalyst in the recombiner had become ineffective, and a high concentration of hydrogen passed downstream to the vault; it apparently exploded there and ignited the charcoal beds. The purging of the vault by nitrogen had extinguished the fire. There were no injuries, and there was no release of radioactivity.","261":"Insufficiently transmissive fuel assembly charged into the reactor one; local overheating caused loss of barriers' integrity between heavy water moderator and fuel with coolant gas (CO2); cladding and steam generator tube corrosion resulted in contamination of the primary and secondary circuit, and of the reactor hall; no significant health impact; reactor decommissioned.","262":"A short circuit, subsequently in both the 220kV lines because of extreme weather, triggered turbine throttling to own power supply level which failed due to falsly adjusted control and opening of gate valves; resulting pressure drop in the primary circuit was interpreted as a large leak followed by an automatic start of the emergency core cooling system; the resulting presssure increase was controlled by opening of relief valves and about 400 cubic meters of hot coolant water were released into the reactor building; the amount of radioactive water was increased by the foreseen operation of the reactor spray system; the radioactive water and radioactive gases were later released to the enviroment in a controlled manner; the costs of repair including decontamination of the reactor building were regarded too high and the plant was permenantly shutdown.","263":"Half of the fuel rods melted, releasing fission products; operators exposed; repairs took more than a year.","264":"The plant operated at full power with a satisfactory leak rate of 5.3 liters\/min when it suddenly developed into rupture of 1250 liters\/min, caused by high stress that resulted from the deformation (corrosion) of support plates. After initial measures including control rod manipulations based on misperception, the operators acted promptly and effectively: at 10 minutes they tripped the turbine which caused an automatic reactor shutdown, started the safety injection system and throttled the injection flow to limit reactor coolant system pressure to 14 MPa. At roughly 18 minutes the operators secured feedwater flow to three intact steam generators and isolated the defective one. At 11 hours 20 minutes the plant reached cold shutdown and isolation of the affected loop A. Minimal release of radioactivity.","265":"During a shutdown-margin test in the midst of a normal refueling the operator made a failure in rod withdrawal; the reactor went critical but was shut down immediately and automatically.","266":"Ice plug formed inside top of off-gas stack, producing a back-pressure permitting release of hydrogen in the off-gas building; hydrogen explosion demolished building; reactor immediately shut down; some release of radioactivity in the vicinity of the explosion; off-gas building was rebuilt, reactor started 11 days later.","267":"Fresh fuel assembly, together with a technological plug, was ejected into the reactor hall after failure of the closing mechanism of a technological channel during fuel loading; CO2 coolant was flowing out until the refueling machine was reconnected; two workers were suffocated by the CO2; no atmospheric release.","268":"Negligent electrical error caused short circuit at transformer, which triggered cable fire with loss of control and power supply of 5 out of 6 main coolant pumps; provisional restoration of power supply; no core damage\/release; returned to operation after repair.","269":"A fuel channel in Unit 1 suffered a loss of coolant, resulting in the degradation of a nuclear fuel assembly that led to a significant release of radiation lasting for one month; no notification of danger in the affected region. (Chernobyl forerunner)","270":"Hydrogen gas explosion at a sump in an auxiliary building; after lifting the manhole cover, two workers physically injured; controlled reactor shutdown; only some radioactivity release in the vicinity of the explosion; restart after short repair.","271":"Seal failure in Main Coolant Pump. At full power, an alarm due to leakage from first-stage seal of primary coolant pump, operators started a controlled shutdown, later shutting off the pump.  Shortly thereafter the reactor scrammed automatically on a signal from one of the steam generators. Circulation of coolant water to the seals of the remaining primary coolant pumps was blocked, so operator restarted the first pump which operated for about 2 hr, but then the remaining seals collapsed, and primary coolant water began to spill into the containment building at a high rate. Circulation of water through the primary system was maintained by auxiliary means until cold shutdown was achieved and the leak in the primary pump was plugged. By this time about 135,000 gal of primary water had escaped, covering the floor of the containment building to about a foot in depth. Escape of radioactivity to the atmosphere was contained within prescribed limits by the filtering system for the containment building.","272":"Fire started when a worker, using a candle to search for air leaks, ignited a combustible seal; fire spread on the reactor building side wall, burning for seven hours and damaging cables, disabling systems related to the control of unit 1 and 2; meltdown was averted; all units refurbished and in operation until shutdown in 1985.","273":"A 470 liters\/minute leak developed in a steam generator due to tube rupture; operators recognized a leak but thought it was in the auxiliary building. Finally charging pumps were started to control the pressurizer level; load reduction began at 30 minutes and the plant was manually tripped at 47 minutes from 25 % power and the safety injection pumps were intermittently used to control the reactor coolant system inventory. At roughly 3 hours the residual heat removal system was placed in operation; minor realease of radioactivity.","274":"Control rods operated to achieve better burnup of the fuel in the core bottom, not in line with guidelines; start of a xenon transient causing power peaking, areal clad perforation and minor release of radioactivity; replacement of a number of fuel elements required.","275":"Leak of steam generator tubes occurred (again) and additional wall thinning was revealed; since then, the reactor was stopped for a long period.","276":"The secondary cooling circuit of Unit 1 ruptured, releasing highly contaminated water into the environment; 3 workers killed (scalded).","277":"Explosion of the reinforced concrete gas decay tank located outside the block 1 building; no casualties.","278":"Five months after unit opened, the unit was shut down when engineers discovered buckling in the steel liner of the concrete dome in which the nuclear reactor is housed.","279":"During friction-timing tests following normal refuelling (with open reactor pressure vessel) a control rod was left in the fully withdrawn position and the operator selected a control rod adjacent to that; the reactor reached criticality due to human error but automatically scrammed before any damage or release of radioactivity occurred.","280":"Steam generator tube leak caused manual shutdown of reactor; outage for repair and resolution of procedural deficiencies extended to 1.1 years.","281":"Broken fuel rods discovered during periodic inspection.","282":"Seawater intrusion into the primary system after tubes in the condenser had corroded. Reactor was undergoing a routine startup, operator noted a problem with a demineralizer, switched to a second demineralizer and proceeded with the startup; half an hour later a failure in the second demineralizer apparent and the operator initiated a deliberate shutdown procedure; an hour later excessive chlorides found in primary water and the reactor was scrammed. The main damage was to all of the 120 instruments that measure the power of the reactor.","283":"Steam generator tube leakage was evidenced, and the reactor was stopped for plugging of about 110 tubes and removal of 10 tubes for about a half year.","284":"Fire at the unit 2 which was nearing completion, not yet been loaded with fuel. Control rooms of both Unit 1 and 2 contained smoke to the extent that breathing apparatus deemed advisable. Fire caused considerable damage to primary auxiliary building and equipment located there.","285":"Starting up phase, doing testing. A spurious signal led to the opening of valves associated with the turbine steam supply, shutting down turbine, causing automatic scram in turn.  Reactor water level dropped, feedwater pumps operated intermittently, bypass valves closed, leading to rising water level. Control room indicated low water level and thus operator increased inflow, flooding the main lines. Attempts to shut off inflow partially failed due to leaking valves. Pressure rose, had to manually open relief valuve, jarring adjacent safety valves open. Containment had to be vented to reduce pressure in drywell. The drywell was contaminated, and there was moderate damage to the wire cables and other electrical equipment in the drywell. Down two months for repair.","286":"A malfunction occurred which closed a valve associated with the steam supply to the turbine; the reactor was normally shutdown but finally automatically scrammed when the pressure began to increase too fast; it was restarted two days later; no injuries or release of radioactivity.","287":"When loading the reactor (at full power), operator erroneously manually (overriding standard procedure since the loading machine correctly stopped the loading) loaded coolant flow restrictor rather than fuel element; part of the uranium fuel (50kg) was damaged and began to melt; contamination of the reactor building\/site; continued operation early 1971.","288":"Rupture of one no-return valve after incorrect switching between two pumps of the recooling system (used to control the temperature of the incoming water from the district heating grid), caused a flood so that the water stream hit the main busbar and caused turbine shutdown; due to short-circuits in the wiring, flooding was not indicated on the control board; flooded cubicle led to numerous undesired system responses; reactor safe shut and cooled down without release.","289":"Fire outside the containment building that damaged penetrating electrical cables caught fire and began to short-circuit; the reactor was shutdown without incident and returned to service after repairs were made; no release of radioactivity.","290":"Partial meltdown apparently caused when a fuel broke and caught fire; melting of one out of a few thousand fuel channels; reactor closed for two years; release of radioactivity.","291":"During power ascension, a zirconium plate at the bottom of the reactor vessel became loose and blocked sodium coolant flow to some fuel subassemblies, out of which two started to melt; manual reactor shut down; no abnormal release; restart three years and nine months later, after clean up and fuel replacement.","292":"Control console circuit damaged during replacement of lightbulb, leading to loss of power to temp, pressure, and water level monitoring instruments. Common-mode failure. Resultant spurious signals automatically shut of secondary feedwater to SG, which dried out.  Emergency aux feedwater started but was stopped by spurious signals. Proper instrumentation restored after 70 minutes.  water-level controls in the steam generators had failed, and the steam generators had been flooded up into the steam lines. Makeup water system plus unexpected opening of relief valve maintained cooling. This created a large heat sink for the water in the primary system, and it cooled beyond expectations. The primary and secondary systems were thoroughly examined for damage, but none was found. Four days after the incident the return to full power was started.","293":"Generic abnormality (all 900 MWe PWR units across 8) that may affect the operation of low-pressure safety injection water pumps and water spray in the enclosure  of. In an accident with a leak in the primary circuit of the reactor, the water that escapes is collected at the reactor building from the bottom and returned to the safety injection system to ensure cooling of the reactor. This water, because of its elevated temperature can eventually cause abnormal vibration pumps causing their failure. ASN verified that solution in place by 31 March 2006.","294":"Possibility, in large-break LOCA, of filter clogging in recirculation circuit relied on for cooling water from the sump once PTR tank empty .  All French nuclear reactors affected, older ones more so due to smaller filtration surfaces. By 2009, filters replaced with larger surfaces at all plants (58 plants, reconstruction of part of the reactor building).","295":"Generic anomaly concerning the valve blockage risk in the recirculation circuit \u2013 used to provide cooling water from the sump in the case of a large break LOCA \u2013 for some 1300 MWe PWR (12 units).  Technical amendments completed in 2003.","296":"Operating at full power when a fault occurred on phase B of the main transformer which caused the generator, turbine, and reactor to trip; station loads were transferred automatically from the normal station service transformer to the reserve station transformer, which receives power from the grid. During the transient which lasted for about 12 cycles, voltage on the station's phase B buses decreased to approximately 50 percent of normal value before returning to normal. This voltage transient resulted in a loss of power output from five of eight non-safety-related uninterruptible power supplies causing the loss of control room annunciators, relevant information about the plant status and some of the lighting of the plant. Nevertheless, the operators were able to verify that the reactor had tripped and was shut down and to  restore power supply. 13 hours later the reactor was in cold shutdown conditions and an hour later the licensee ended the site area emergency.","297":"While attempting to bring the unit up to power the operator experienced certain mechanical difficulties and a steam generator transient resulted in a reactor shutdown; an analysis of the event sequence revealed that critical breakers in the automatic shutdown circuits had failed and if the operators had not automatically activated the circuit breakers the event could have resulted in a severe (ATWS-type) event; the outage was caused by inadequate maintenance and supervisory practices. The NRC allowed to restart Salem 1 and required BWR owners to install hardware modifications to make the event less likely and more manageable.","298":"This second Salem 1 outage occurred between February 24, 1984, and May 31, 1984. The record discloses that incompletely cured resins caused certain stator coils to vibrate, eventually resulting in fatigue failure and generator shutdown. It is essentially undisputed that the defective manufacture of the coils was responsible for their ultimate failure. The PUC concluded, however, that the replacement power costs associated with this outage (approximately $27 million) were to be borne by the utility rather than the ratepayers, based on its determination that the ratepayers were not at fault and that PECO was the party most capable of pursuing legal and contractual remedies against the manufacturer, Westinghouse Electric Corporation (Westinghouse). [a33]","299":"Reactor shut down automatically on April 7 while reactor operators tried to gain control after sea grass clogged the plant's water intakes. When the plant's emergency coolant-injection system activated twice, the utility declared an alert, the third-highest nuclear emergency. Regulators (NRC) blamed the shutdown on a combination of operator error, poor training, previously identified equipment problems and inadequate direction. The NRC is particularly concerned because communications between senior station managment and the staff have been deficient for some time, and the deficiencies have contributed to a number of prior events. During the eight weeks, Salem 1 was shut down, the utilities were forced to buy replacement power at up to $500,000 (1994USD) a day; utilities are spending $150 million to improve equipment and training, in addition to the $300 million spent since 1990. Those costs are shared by the co-owners.","300":"The main turbine and generator sustained damage when the turbine failed to trip during testing.  'Preventable': a long-unrepaired, known to be degraded, valve inoperative due to mechanical binding.

Steam leak occurred in the 150 psig high-pressure exhaust steam line from the' Unit 1 turbine. The leak originated from an 8-in, crack on a weld joining 24-in.-diameter piping with the 37.5-in.-diameter high pressure steam exhaust pipe leading to the moisture separator reheater.","305":"Identified corrosion problems at steam generators gave rise to concerns regarding multiple steam generator leaks and the potential for a main steam line break accident  followed by a significant primary-to-secondary leakage that could result in a loss of coolant and damage of the core. Diagnosed sleeve weld circumferential fault causing steam leak, along with widespread corrosion of the steam generators,turned too costly to repair and thus resulting in indefinite shutdown. [587]","306":"SG tube degradation contributed to the decision to permanently shut down the unit.","307":"The discovery of corroded and leaking heat exchange tubes during routine maintenance leads to a 14-month shutdown for refueling and $67.7 million worth of repairs to the plant\u2019s steam generators. [a136]","308":"Partial loss of in-plant ac electrical power while the plant was operating at 60 % power. Following a manual reactor trip, the plant lost all in-plant AC power for four minutes and experienced a severe incidence of water hammer in the feedwater system which caused a leak, damaged plant equipment, and challenged the integrity of the plant's heat sink. The most significant aspect of the event involved the failure of five safety related check valves in the feedwater system which appeared in less than a year, without detection, and jeopardized the integrity of safety systems. The event involved a number of equipment malfunctions, operator error, and procedural deficiencies.","309":"Degraded tube forced 12 day outage.","310":"Scheduled down time to replace degraded steam generator, allowing for an uprating (planning to restart in April 2011). Operator, Progress Energy, made (unprecedented) choice to manage SG replacement itself, instead of using experienced contractors. A hole was made in the plant's concrete-reinforced steel containment structure for the replacement of its steam generators. This caused part of the concrete to delaminate (60-by-82-foot hourglass-shaped delamination around the opening). Attempts to repair were made, but the problem persisted. Decision to shut down plant in 2013. [a76-a80]","311":"Hydraulic oil fire broke out in the area of a hydraulic valve (HV-2292) in the turbine building.  A manual reactor scram was inserted because of an indicated loss of primary and secondary coolant flow. The fire was extinguished by the plant fire brigade, caused millions of dollars worth of damage. Repairs were made, the reactor was again taken critical on December 11th. ","312":"During routine surveillance testing a control rod drive assembly was found to malfunction.  The plant was shut down and preparations for repair and return to service were begun.  However, during a routine walkdown by one of the plant engineers, hairline cracks were found in the inconel steel main steam ring header immediately below the reactor.  This ring header received steam from the steam generators in the reactor prior to the steam's short trip to the turbine generator.  The hairline cracks proved to be the last straw for Fort St. Vrain.  Based on this turn of events, the PSC Board of Directors announced the decision to terminate operations at Fort St. Vrain effective on August 29, 1989.

Reactor returned to service with modified fuel.","315":"The day after its official inauguration, a human and technical handling error caused a cylinder of graphite, used in the initial phase to control core reactivity, to enter a channel filled with fuel elements. Its presence interrupted their cooling, causing two new fuel elements to melt. There was no effect on the environment, but the reactor was out of operation for one year.","316":"During startup a faulty measurement of gas temperature at the core exit, combined with human error and unusual physical conditions (xenon effect, rod position and moderator temperature) which greatly distorted the axial flux curve, caused cladding to begin melting in 33 core channels. This accident had no effect on reactor operation or on the environment. [a93]","317":"76 of the 185 control rods failed to fully insert during a routine shutdown at TVA's Browns Ferry Unit No 3 located at Athens Alabama.  The reactor was manually scrammed from about 30 percent power in accordance with routine shutdown procedures. The shutdown was initiated to repair the  feedwater system. The 76 control rods that failed to fully insert were all on  the east side of the core. Following scram discharge volume (SDV) high level bypass and a short drain period of the SDV, a second manual scram was initiated and all partially inserted rods were observed to drive inward, but 59 remained partially withdrawn. A third manual scram was made, again following high level in the SDV and bypassing for another short drain of the SDV, with the result that 47  rods remained partially withdrawn. Following a longer drain of the SDV, an  automatic scram occurred that was initiated by a scram discharge volume tank  high water level signal when the scram reset switch was placed in \"Normal\";  with this scram all remaining rods fully inserted. The total time elapse from  the initial scram to the time that all rods were inserted was approximately 15  minutes. Core coolant flow, temperature and pressure remained normal for plant  conditions. The unit is now shutdown and additional testing indicates that a possible cause of the malfunction was the retention of a significant amount of  water in the east bank scram discharge volume.","318":"Cracking in recirculation piping was discovered in the 22-inch manifold and 12-inch riser piping (in 1983, the stainless steel piping in the recirculation system and several connected branch systems was replaced).","319":"Manually scrammed due to lowering reactor water level resulting from a trip of all three of the reactor feed pumps, due to a loss of power to the pump seal cooling water flow switch relays and resultant automatic actuation of the feed pump trip circuit. Corrective action was taken to repair the ground fault in the associated circuits and to revise reactor feed pump trip circuit design. With the plant online at 98% power, all three of the plant's main feedwater pumps tripped causing a drop of the reactor water level. The reactor subsequently tripped. The loss of feedwater and sudden trip from the high power level caused the reactor water level to drop below -46 inches. After passing this point, the emergency core cooling system automatically activated. The RCIC and HPCI systems promptly restored the reactor water level to normal.","320":"A botched valve repair prevented other key valves from opening; tests after the valve repairs failed to detect the problem; the reactor operated for nearly 18 months with systems that provide emergency cooling water to the core and containment vessel disabled.","321":"Shortly after the reactor was shut down for a refuelling outage, a large quantity of reactor coolant system water was released to the containment building during in-situ testing of a safety relief valve. There were no injuries and no release of radiation outside the containment. As a result of investigations by the licensee and by NII these valves are now removed for testing to a separate test facility and many of the station operating instructions were amended to better aid the operators in their response to alarms. [a120]","322":"Electrical transformer fire, just weeks after coming back online following similar incident, led to shutdown. Plan to buy two new transformers and install in Spring 2010. Plans dropped after 2011 decision to shut all 17 German NPP by 2022. Vattenfall 2015 submitted an application to decommission and dismantle.  Shutdown led to a partial blackout in Hamburg (for an hour): In the big city the largest part of the traffic light systems failed, shopping centers lacked hourlight. Because water pumps were also lame because of the power failure, the result was pipebreaks, which meant that many households were cut off from the water supply. The Atomic Authority in Kiel ordered a \"reliability test\" from the operator Vattenfall. The shutdown of Kruemmel has prompted Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel to call for the immediate closure of the eight oldest plants. \n[a122, a123]","323":"The water retaining ring of the generator broke due to stress corrosion and caused massive damage to the generator, the turbine unit and the turbine hall; the short circuit ignited lubricating oil and caused a fire around the generator and destroying some cables.","324":"During routine surveillance at approximately 100% power,  manual isolation valves in both of the containment spray headers were found closed, rendering both trains of the containment spray system (CSS) inoperable. Misalignment of the isolation valves was caused by improper use of the valve alignment checklist for the CSS when leaving the shutdown cooling  mode.  Plant is fined $125,000 because cooling system valves were closed during full operation.","325":"The loss of the hydrogen side sealing oil pump and other problems in the sealing oil system resulted in the escape of hydrogen from the generator. Hydrogen escaped for several minutes before it exploded; the following fire burned for five to eight minutes. Reactor shutdown.","326":"Due to torsional vibrations of generator's rotor some LP turbine's blades broke. Rotor got into unbalance which caused break down of generator sealings; leaking hydrogen and oil caught fire. Generator and exciter were damaged badly; plant shut down.","327":"The French nuclear safety authority (ASN) has requested five of EDF's nuclear power units are taken offline for additional inspections on their steam generators within the next three months. The steel in parts of those components has been found to contain high concentrations of carbon. In June, the ASN said it had identified 18 French nuclear power reactors operated by EDF - of both 900 and 1450 MWe capacity - whose steam generators could contain high carbon concentrations. ASN said EDF has provided it with data aimed at demonstrating the operating safety of the 12 reactors concerned.

The activation of the circuit could have resulted in the cracks (several centimeters long) bursting open and thus jeopardizing the safety of the reactor. However, a preliminary study seems to indicate that the safety margins used in the circuit calculations would have made it possible to bring the reactor to a safe shutdown state.","520":"While the reactor was shut down for a full inspection and fuel reloading, the pumps of the shutdown cooling system (RRA) showed signs of abnormal functioning; this anomaly became apparent during emptying of the primary circuit, before the vessel is opened. The facility's control team reacted immediately by interrupting the emptying operation and adding make-up water to the reactor vessel.This stage of emptying of the primary circuit, which is carried out while the core is loaded with fuel, is rather tricky as the water level must be reduced while still keeping a sufficient reserve above the core.","521":"During a cold shutdown, after reloading of the core introduction in the primary circuit of ten cubic meters of pure water from a safety injection accumulator that had been hydro tested, the operators immediately added boron to the primary circuit.\nBASIS FOR RATING: Table A2 (addendum p. 9) with initiator possible.

Both relief valves in the pressurizer opened but a few seconds later only one of them closed and the pressure in the primary system dropped leading to reactor scram and shut down of the second turbine. Water and steam poured out of the pressurizer through the stuck open relief valve and filled the drain tank. At 3 minutes the operator realized the situation and closed the block valve; a rupture seal on the drain tank blew, allowing primary water to spill onto the floor of the containment building. The high-pressure injection system was turned on and turned-off manually because conditions had stabilized. At 12 minutes procedures were initiated to bring the reactor to a cold shut down.","523":"Both units (A and B) were in operation at full power when heavy storms knocked out power lines in the station vicinity. Because of an incorrectly set electrical switch and a faulty pressure gauge, the unit B turbine did not drop, as designed, from 1,300 to 60 megawatts, maintaining station power after separating from the grid, resulting in a reactor scram; all four emergency diesel generators started. Another emergency supply, over four trains from Biblis A, also started but, because of a switching failure, one of the lines failed to connect. These lines would have been relied upon as a backup to bring emergency diesel power from unit B to unit A, in case needed.\nThe result was a partial disabling of the emergency power supply from Biblis-B to Biblis-A for about two hours. Then, the affected switch was manually set by operating personnel.","524":"Loss of residual heat removal; the operators allowed the water level to drop to an abnormally low level. Air was ingested into the RHR system and two pumps lost their prime. After 25 minutes, water had been resupplied and the pumps were restarted. The direct cause of the event was an erroneous assessment of the primary water level required to drain the steam generator tubes. The procedure was deficient. Also, the level must be decreased below the alarm setpoint, so there is no additional alarm available for the level at which pumps lose prime. The water level instruments were insufficient. Corrective actions include modifications in procedures and an improved level measurement system.","525":"During normal power operation a fire detector reported a fire in the room of the second category of reliability buses. The buses did not lose voltage. In order to repair damaged parts the operational personnel tripped the reactor by standard procedure.

The rate of insertion did, however, ensure that the temperature rise was controlled.","528":"During routine refuelling at full power, a reactor coolant leak of 1.4 t\/hr developed in the fuelling vault. Operators determined that the east fuelling bridge had dropped 40 cm. The reactor was shutdown and cooled; coolant pressure was maintained by transfer from other units and recovery from sump. Total leakage was approx. 10% of the inventory. No safety system operation was required with the exception of containment box-up on high activity after one hour; no abnormal release of radioactivity to the environment.","529":"The maintenance cooling system (MCS) pump tripped on electrical protection loss of one phase of off-site power. Operators attempted to restore maintenance cooling using the alternate MCS pump, but it failed to start. After several attempts, neither MCS pump could run for more than several minutes before tripping on electrical protection, and a loss of maintenance cooling was declared. At this point, the time to reach 90 C core temperature (cold shutdown limit) was more than seven hours. The direct cause of the loss of maintenance cooling was an ungrounded open phase condition on a 230-kV drop line to the in-service system service transformer. The high-voltage ground fault alarm, credited to monitor for open phase or imbalance conditions on the in-service TSS, did not alarm and indicate a fault.","530":"During the annual shut-down for refuelling a filter has been discovered on a draining circuit of the reactor cavity. This filter, installed during the last outage period, should have been dismantled before the start up of the plant in 1991. The presence of this filter could affect the efficiency of the recirculation process in certain hypothetical situations.","531":"On 12 June, when the reactor was undergoing startup tests and was operating for the first time at 30% of full power, a failure in the conventional part of the facility reduced the steam generator feedwater flow below the required minimum, and this triggered the automatic shutdown request. The order was in fact given, but the control rods did not drop into the core because of missing wiring in the two lines of the shutdown system. This incident had no safety consequences because the other protective actions taken brought the reactor into a safe state: the automatic shutdwon was not essential owing to the low power of the reactor, and the startup testing period thus had the advantage to detect the anomaly before the reactor was taken to higher power.","532":"After unit shutdown for preventive maintenanc,e during the routine test of reactor overpower emergency protection in the low power range (LPEP) the failure of ionization chamber power supply cabinets of 3 trains out of 4 due to insulation damage of the +500 V power cable was found. The damage (melting) of cable insulation occurred due to high temperature in the room, where the cable route passes. Operating personnel activated only AZM protection (power level emergency protection) and started to perform refueling (unloading of the spent fuel assembly, installation of additional absorber) without activating the LPEP protection, which is forbidden by the procedure. In fact, because of the effect of Reactor Protection System (RPS) normal interlocking the LPEP protection could not be activated at any position of RPS control rods.","533":"While loading three new rejected fuel assemblies (FAs) into the shipping cask the rupture of the hoist cable with subsequent FA dropping occurred, which resulted in new FA damage. No damage to fuel rod cladding and no radioactivity releases occurred. The cause of cable rupture was the failure of the hoist end switch.\nBASIS FOR RATING: Initiator - real, possible (new FA dropping). Safety function availability - full. According to Table A2 level 1 (A-2R) is assigned. Event cause reveals safety culture deficiencies (deficiencies in organizational-technical measures for FA transportation) and therefore the level higher by 1 has been chosen.","534":"During shut down for inspection and refuelling, the operator discovered while inspecting the civil engineering that the tie rods of the reactor pit lateral stops had loosened.\nThe reactor pit is a concrete structure which supports the reactor vessel. It lies on the basemat and bears at the sides on the concrete which covers the basemat through 18 stops. Each stop is attached to the concrete with eight prestressed anchoring bars. This device is intended to absorb the horizontal stresses which could be generated during an earthquake, thus protecting the reactor vessel. Several of these bars were found to be loose and corroded, calling the reactor vessel pit's earthquake resistance into question.","535":"A higher than foreseen boron concentration was dicovered on units B1 and B2, due to a calibration error on the measuring device.\nCommon mode failure.","536":"Flooding. Dikes and levees collapsed around the site. An NRC Information Notice subsequently issued nearly a year later (NRC IN-94-27) indicated that below grade rooms in the reactor and turbine buildings had extensive leakage with rising water levels. The notice stated that \u201cthe floor drain system had backed up so that standing water from within areas known to be radiologically contaminated had migrated out into designated clean areas.\u201d  The NRC inspectors noted that plant personnel \u201chad not established measures to divert the water away from important components.\u201d For example, water levels rising inside the reactor building impinged on electrical cables and equipment such as the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) pump room causing the circuitry to ground out. \u201cThis event demonstrates that flooding problems and degradation of equipment may be caused by water inleakage even though flood waters are not above grade elevations,\u201d the information notice indicated. The RCIC system is critical to plant safety in the event of loss of offsite power and a condition known as \u201cStation Blackout.\u201d","537":"When entering a shutdown state, the Safety Injection System was made unavailable due to the application of an erroneous operating rule, which does not permit to fulfill the requirements of technical specifications. This rule had been written by the Tricastin Plant and was also used as it was (i.e. with the error) by Dampierre and Bugey plants.","538":"A leakage has been detected on a piping connected to the primary circuit. The leak rate increased and led the operator to shutdown the reactor in order to localize the leak before reaching the safety threshold of 230 l\/hour. The operator localized a non isolable primary water leak on a piping connecting the safety injection system to the plant primary system, probably due to thermal fatigue. The defected part of the pipe has been replaced during a one month outage.\nThe damaged pipe length has been examined at the irradiated material workshop at Chinon and the preliminary expertise concluded to a through-wall crack located on a portion of straight piping and not on specific areas such as bends and welds as it could be expected. The most probable hypothesis is that the origin of this crack is due to a thermal fatigue due to a variation of temperature produced by cold water coming from non-tight valves located upstream.\nThe operator, EDF, decided to make controls on straight parts of the piping during scheduled outages on 900 MW plants and, in some cases, decided specific outages.\nOther defects have been found on two pipes at Dampierre 3 in March 1997 and on Fessenheim 2 in April 1997 (so that other portions of pipes have been replaced and will be expertised).\nEDF has provided DSIN with a study on the evolution of the phenomenon. It appears that on a particular pipe small non-detectable defects can potentially lead to a through-wall crack within less of a cycle if these defects are initiated and stand small cold leaks from upstream valves.\nThe analysis of this study by DSIN has led to re-rate the incident level 2.\nStill, EDF will give its strategy to solve this problem on the mean term by the end of June. Until the implementation of this strategy EDF will have to proceed to specific additional controls on these pipes.","539":"The operator discovered that the iodine filtering circuit of the control room ventilation system was unavailable. This anomaly was due to the presence (since 23 December 1991) of plugs in both the lines of the circuit.","540":"A loss-of-flow event occurred, initiated by a switchyard transformer explosion, resulting in the loss of Class IV power to Unit 4 and a consequential turbine trip. The Reactor Regulating System responded by initiating a reactor stepback to 60 %FP. The HT pumps tripped because of the loss of Class IV power, significantly reducing the coolant flow through the channels. The resulting increase in heat transport system pressure was sufficient to activate opening of the LRVs, which provided pressure relief via discharge to the shell side of the bleed condenser. The bleed condenser high pressure alarm was activated shortly thereafter. As the HT pumps continued to run down, the measured flow in the SDS channels dropped below 20.5 kg\/s, the HTLF setpoint for both SDS1 and SDS2 at reactor powers greater than 70% FP. A SDS1 trip was initiated at this time. Due to instrument sampling time, the SDS2 low flow trip was initiated shortly afterwards.","541":"The plant is equipped with 4 internal cooling fans to provide for cooling capacity inside the reactor containment after a Design Basis Accident and together with the spray system to reduce pressure and temperature inside the reactor containment. During the last outage period, the licensee performed additional verifications of the tightness of the containment cooling fans motors. These motors should be able to operate under severe environmental conditions (high pressure and temperature) and their tightness is required, according to the original qualification tests, to prevent significant introduction of water and\/or steam into the motor casing. The leak tightness tests showed that all the motors were not in conformity with the test acceptance criteria, therefore the licensee could not demonstrate the availability of these motors under accident conditions.","542":"Recent results of the qualification testsof 3 electric containment penetrations as well as of other safety related connectors, for large loss of coolant and steam line break conditions, have shown that the insulation of the connectors is significantly degraded after a few minutes. While automatic protection of the reactor remains unaffected, the post accident control room activities could be made more difficult. After a detailed analysis of the situation it was concluded that the accidents can be mastered provided that additional procedural measures are taken. Some of the connectors have been modified immediately, others will be modified during the next refueling outage.","543":"A short circuit occurred in an external switching station and resulted in a disconnection of both 400 kV and 110 kV lines to all four units: Unit 1 failed to cope with the load rejection, it resulted in a reactor scram. Unit 2 and 4 reduced their power to the level of self-consumption. Unit 3 that had been shut down for refuelling, lost power supply and one of its two operable diesel generators (DGs) failed to start automatically.","544":"Reactor 21 automatically tripped from full load on rate of change of Boiler Gas Outlet Temperature following a trip of the Main Boiler Feed Pump. The Emergency Boiler Feedpump was unavailable at the time of the trip due to maintenance. The Start-Up Boiler Feedpump was put into service manually when it did not automatically start, but it had to be shut down soon afterwards due to a priming oil pump problem which caused a small fire exinguished by the station fire team. With no high pressure feed pumps available the boilers were part depressurised using the Boiler Emergency Depressurisation Valves and the reactor cooled with feed provided from the Shut-Down Boiler Feedpump. Approximately one hour after the automatic reactor trip, the calculated average Gas Circulator Inlet Temperature for Boiler 22 exceeded the Operating Rule Limit of 300 degrees Celsius by 2.3 degrees  for approximately 30-40 seconds. This was a consequence of starting the Gas Circulator Low Speed Pony Motors whilst the boilers were being fed by low capacity feed pumps.","545":"While undertaking a boiler tube seal weld repair on a superheater on Reactor 21 a crack of significant extent was discovered in a weld adjacent to the tube plate. The mechanism for the crack was not yet determined and the potential could not be discountede for similar cracks to occur on Reactor 22 which would be outside the operational safety case. The conservative decision has been taken to affect a controlled shutdown of Reactor 22.\nArising from the discovery a Project Team has been set up under the chairmanship of a company Engineering Division senior manager. The team will have responsibility for managing all aspects of the project including investigation of the causes, additional inspections, repairs and production of the safety case for return to service.\nJustification of Rating:\nPotential initiator with full safety function availability gives a basic rating upper limit of 2. The guidance then allows for adjustment dependent upon the likelihood that the defect would have led to component failure.\nThe mechanism of component degradation is not yet fully understood, but the extent of the cracking is such that there appears to be little margin to failure remaining. Additionally, it is clear that the failure of this component was considered in the safety case to be unlikely, and therefore no routine surveillance programmes were in place to monitor the weld.\nGiven the above situation, INES level 2 appears appropriate based on the current level of understanding. This is confirmed by verification as an incident with significant failures in safety provisions.","546":"A metallurgical flaw (11 cm long, 3 cm deep) was discovered during checks carried out on one of the secondary circuit pipes feeding the turbine generator.\n\nBASIS FOR RATING: Potential consequences on the safety of the installation (third barrier fault).\nDIFFICULTIES IN RATING: This classification may be reassessed following the results of expertise. table A1 - inadequate \u2013 possible.","547":"There was an event at Fukushima Dai-ichi in 1993 where seawater from a corroded pipe leaked into the turbine building and flooded the emergency power supply. Based on this event (alone) a frequency of 10-3 per year for a scenario with a flooding of the below ground levels of the turbine hall and an extended SBO would have been merited.","548":"At 16:26 a heat transport (HT) leak due to a passing pressurizer drain valve was detected, allowoing hot D2O to flow directly into the HT collection system. The 0.5 kg\/s leak filled the collection system with hot D2O and steam which backed up collection lines to other parts of the HT system, including the feed pumps. A total of 10m3 of D2O was spilled into several areas of the reactor building. A controlled shutdown of the unit was initiated at 18:20 with cooldown and depressurization achieved by 00:30 the next morning. A radiological alert was declared at 19:00 with increased airborne tritium concentrations in the reactor building . Following manual containment isolation reactor building pressure rose to 2.28 kPa. With the authorization of the advisory group the containment pressure was vented through driers. External release of tritium for the day following the event was estimated at less than 1% of the Derived Operational Limit.","549":"During the yearly outage for checking and refuelling an inspection revealed that 2 valves of an auxiliary circuit were blocked in close position. The investigations undertaken have shown that the valves have been blocked in closed position since the reactor began operating in 1985. As a result of this detection EDF has started a campaign for all other pressurized water reactors to verify the availability of valves of the same type which showed that 30 pressure valves were not operative. These were in circuits classed as \"important for safety\": in the component cooling circuit - and in the case of Gravelines - and in other circuits.\nRelating to other anomalies mentioned in Magnuc (information system of the French Nuclear Safety Authority, SCSIN) (anomalies of maintenance, of sand filters, anomalies in the installation of sump filters) which are affecting the quality of installation completion of pressurized water reactors, the Ministers of Industry and the Environment asked EDF to make a special effort to detect such problems. It is by making such an effort that EDF discovered that valves in certain auxiliary circuits were not in the right state to fulfill their function.\nIt is therfore welcome to encourage the efforts made by EDF and to correct such anomalies; at first these efforts could lead to an increase in the anomalies detected. But on the other hand, it is appropriate to state that the final phase of reactor construction proves yet again that it may conceal some significant errors in the organization of quality control. Upgrading the level of quality control at certain construction sites appears even more indispensable. In the first analysis these anomalies found in the auxiliary systems classed as \"important for safety\" do not seem to have resulted in an important cummulative risk, but it is worrying that there has been lack of compliance with installation methods, with control and quality assurance of the circuits concerned, and this demands deeper analysis.","550":"After checking the resin content of the K-filter and connection of the water cleaning system with the primary circuit, a leakage of the seal of the fill-in nozzle at the filter occurred. The nozzle is situated in the reactor hall out of the pressure room system. The personnel violated several operating instructions but the reactor was not shut down as prescribed in such situations. \nBASIS FOR RATING: No off-site impact, no on-site impact. Defence-in-depth (A-1R) 0\/1. Violation of operating instructions, human error +1, with deficiency in safety culture = 2. \nDIFFICULTIES IN RATING: Judgement of the design deficiency by the containment aperture for the filter nozzle in the reactor hall and air ventilation system in the hall without filtration.","551":"After the monthly control of the nuclear monitoring system it was not noticed by the personnel, that the ionization chambers of the low and middle range of that system after controlling were driven out of their working range and not driven back. This faulty position was observed 24 hours later after controlling by a shift-physicist. During this period the nuclear monitoring system for the cold shutdown stage of the reactor was not available. The shutdown concentration of boric acid in the primary circuit during this time was 17.1 g\/l.","552":"Turbine trip\/Reactor trip due to loss of condenser vacuum. During normal operation, loss of condenser vacuum caused reactor trip. During transient period, turbine driven auxilary feed water pump as tripped.  \nEvent sequence was,1) Condenser A Expansion joint seal water low-level alarm occured, 2) condenser A expansion joint breach confirmed, 3) although emergency recovery action was taken, failed to recover condenser vacuum, 4) main turbine tripped and thus reactor tripped. Cause of breach of condenser expasion joint was aging.","553":"During normal operation, a CEA (control element assembly) dropped by the inadequate opening of a motor-generator set output breaker in the process of the 1st periodic test of the  Automatic Seismic Trip System (ASTS). The reactor was tripped but the turbine was not tripped because there was no turbine trip signal unlike reactor protection signal. The sustained turbine operation caused the rapid decrease of the main steam line pressure, and the Safety Injection System was actuated by main steam line low-pressure. Upon investigation, it was identified that there was an error in an electric contact of ASTS circuit; it was also identified that there were insufficiencies in the alarm system and management of design change and test.","554":"During an overhaul, a switchyard circuit breaker was opened by protective relay actuation of Start-Up Transformer (SUT) on a test after the replacement of a high voltage circuit breaker of 13.8kV non-safety bus. The off-site power was lost and emergency diesel generators started automatically due to low voltage at the 4.16kV safety bus. Upon investigation, the licensee\u2019s pre-review about the probability of protective relay actuation in the condition of energized SUT was inadequate.","555":"The reactor was starting up after the shutdown due to the failure of main generator on March 23, when actuation of condenser steam dump valves caused the feedwater control system transient while dumping the surplus steam, which was generated in the steam generator, to condenser. Subsequently, while controlling the S\/G water level, the TBN and reactor were tripped due to the S\/G water level high-high signal. The failure of the condenser steam dump valves was due to failed actuation of the condenser steam dump valve (one of three valves in the condenser dump valve group #1). It increased the power deviation between the reactor and the TBN, and opened the 6 valves in the dump valve group #2. Therefore, too much steam was released to condenser, and S\/G pressure was relieved. The S\/G water level rapidly increased due to the swelling, and it caused TBN trip and actuated feedwater isolation signal. In spite of the activities to supply main feedwater and to recover the water level, the opening of the main feedwater isolation valve was delayed, and subsequently, the reactor tripped owing to S\/G water level low-low signal. All the safety parameters were maintained within the allowable range, and there was no impact on the reactor safety.\nBesides the failed actuation of pressure balancing valve of the condenser dump valve, it was found to be hard for the operator to predict the plant status correctly and understand the characteristics and functions sufficiently. In other words, the operator could not properly cope with the failed actuation of the dump valve even though recognizing it in advance, and operated the unit without incorporating operating experience that TBN startup should be commenced at above 15% reactor power. \nCondenser steam dump valve was dismantled and inspected, and startup operating procedure was revised to prevent transient at low power. In addition, SGWLCS (Steam Generator Water Level Control System) was changed to a digitally-controlled SGWLCS. The reactor reached to the criticality at 02:38 on March 24 and synchronized at 05:14 on March 25. While evaluating INES (International Nuclear Event Scale) grade, it was upgraded by applying \u201csafety culture deficiencies\u201d as the operator did not observe the procedure, and thus evaluated as \u201cScale 1.\u201d","556":"Manual reactor trip for maintenance of heated junction thermocouple instrumentation flange assembly of reactor vessel.","557":"During normal power operation, a power range high flux rate protection signal was generated from ex-core nuclear instrumentation, and reactor was tripped.   Upon investigation, while at work to correct the abnormal condition of the \u2018power range high flux rate\u2019 trip signal at channel 2 replacing the malfunctioned channel, the additional signal was activated from channel 3 due to the abnormal signal of the channel. As a result, reactor was tripped by the coincident logic signals at the both channels (2\/4 logic circuit).    Causes and Corrective Actions   It was identified that the malfunction was due to an improper polarity installation of the tantal capacitor in upper-lower channel power summation card in accordance with the erroneous design drawing.   The following corrective actions were implemented.   - Replacement and test of the power summation card with correct polarity installation of the tantal capacitor   - Inspection on circumjacent equipments and validation of their integrity    - Planning of the detailed inspection on the cards by manufacturer","558":"During refueling outage, inadvertent Safety Injection (SI) occurred due to reactor protection signal in the process of Reactor Coolant System (RCS) heat up for the plant startup. \n Upon investigation, it was identified that pressurizer low pressure setpoint was set improperly due to the missing out of system restoration after the calibration of plant protection system and the omission of set point check steps (initial condition and notice) in General Operating Procedure (GOP) for RCS startup. And reactor protection signal (pressurizer low pressure signal) occurred at pressure 35kg\/m2 in the RCS heat up process. \n\nCauses and Corrective Actions \n This event occurred due to pressurizer low-pressure false signal caused by accumulated human errors. The following corrective actions were implemented.","559":"During Reactor Coolant System(RCS) heatup following the completion of overhaul maintenance, the Ulchin Unit 1 experienced a spurious Safety Injection(SI) due to the \u201cMain Steam Line High Differential Pressure\u201d at 21:44 on May 7, 2006. Upon investigation, it was verified that the main steam line pressure of the Steam Generator(S\/G) \u2018B\u2019 continuously indicated zero bar(g) even though those of S\/G \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019 were increasing when the unit experienced the Main Steam Line High Differential Pressure. Because the isolation valve of the main steam line B pressure transducer was closed, the main steam line pressure of S\/G \u2018B\u2019 was not being measured. The I&C contractor personnel who carried out the calibration for the S\/G pressure transducer on April 18 did not reopen that isolation valve after the calibration, and so the isolation valve of the main steam line B pressure transducer was inadvertently closed. Following the actuation of SI, all the safety-related systems and components were operated as expected and the emergency operating procedure for the spurious safety injection was entered and exited about 5 minutes after the SI actuation. Since the RCS pressure was above the shutoff head of the LHSI(low head safety injection) pump, SI flow into the RCS did not occur. The plant was maintained in operational mode 5 after SI termination so that the RCS pressure could be controlled via the pressurizer.","560":"During plant startup following the completion of unscheduled maintenance work for the main  generator hydrogen leakage with the reactor at critical condition on Oct. 11, 2006, the RCS pressure was identified to be decreased abnormally.  The operator discovered that the pressure decrease was due to fail-opening of the pressurizer spray valve and took immediate actions to recover the RCS pressure.  \nThe following are the plant responses and the operator actions in time sequence.  \n\n 13:30 Complete the maintenance work for the hydrogen leakage of main generator.  \n 14:05 Start heat-up operation for the main steam-line  \n 14:40 Reactor critical  \n 15:37 Identify RCS pressure decrease and discover fail-opening spray valve(RCP 001VP)  \n 15:40 Stop RCP #003PO to isolate the spray flow Enter into subcriticality using control bank insertion \n 15:41 Intentional blockage of SI signal upon P-11(at 134bar.a)  \n 15:47 RCS pressure reached the pressurizer low pressure SI setpoint(118.7bar.g)  \n 15:49 Stop RCP #002PO 15:54 Start RCP #002PO and stop RCP #001PO  \n 15:55 RCS pressure reached 111bar  \n 16:00 Inspect spray valve(RCP 001VP)  \n 16:20 Manually close spray valve(RCP 001VP) in the field  \n 16:22 Start RCP #001PO  \n 16:26 RCS restored NOP(155bar) and NOT(286\u2103)  \nWith an abnormal depressurization condition, the operator intentionally blocked the SI signal  which ought to be done during normal cooldown operation only. Even with RCP #003PO and #002PO stop the RCS depressurization continued. During further depressurization, the operator should have actuated the manual SI when the pressure decreased to the low pressre SI setpoint(118.7bar.g) but the shift crew could not actuate manual SI. And they only considered the fail-opening of spray valve and neglect any other possible accidental condition in the FSAR. \nThis was an evident and intentional inappropriate defeat of safety injection.  \n\nWhen the operator stopped RCP #001PO, the primary system recovered normal pressure and temperature. After recovering the RCS pressure the plant was maintained in hot standby condition and the RCS pressure was maintained at 155 bar.  \n\nUpon investigation, one of the two spray valves was found to be fail-open due to loosening of the travel pin nut which comprised the pneumatic positioner of the spray valve. Thus the travel pin was separated from the assembly which resulted in the actuation of the rotary shaft arm and continuous supply of IA(instrument air) to the valve and this caused the valve to fail-open. During the previous 13th overhaul, the valve positioner was replaced with a new one and the travel pin and nut was reassembled. It was estimated that there were some inferiorities while carrying out the reassembling work.  \n\nThere was an unmeasurable and unaccountable loss of safety function associated with this inappropriate defeat of SI and there were a great deficit in the safety culture of the shift operators and the utility. But there was no radiation release to the site nor to the environment.","561":"Ulchin Unit-4 was shutdown on April 5, 2002, for 3rd refueling outage. At the beginning stage of plant cooldown, at 18:33, the operators observed notable decreasing of pressurizer level and pressure and, in response, the operator isolated the CVCS letdown with starting of the third charging pump to compensate the loss of primary coolant inventory. During the operator counter actions, at 18:46, the radiation monitors of SG #2 sampling line alarmed with the increasing of SG #2 level to diagnose the operators the event as SGTR. The operators isolated the affected SG and actuated the safety injection (SI) according to the EOP. The pressurizer level was recovered by the HPSI flow, and the reactor was depressurized and cooled down using the intact SG to terminate the leak flow. At 19:59, the RCS and SG pressures were equalized, and the SI was terminated followed by plant cooling down using SG backfill operation. At 02:58 on the following day, the plant went into the shutdown cooling system operation and exit from EOP. At 13:25, the plant reached cold shutdown condition. No environmental impact and no radiation exposure of the plant staff were reported. After the event, the close investigation was performed and the result showed that single tube located at hot-leg side of SG #2 was ruptured circumferentially due to primarily on the PWSCC. As the results, tube plugging for affected tubes and installation of stabilizer for adjacent tubes of SG #2 were conducted. In addition, the post actions including the reinforcement of SG maintenance program were accompanied. The rating of the event was determined as level 1 based on the point of the defence in depth criteria of INES manual.","562":"While cutting back the power, a leakage occurred due to the damage on the pipes of the NSCW (Nuclear Service Cooling Water) system. But, the operator failed to recover it and this train became inoperable status. So, according to the technical specification, the operator manually shut down the reactor. After the shutdown, the operator switched it over to operation mode \u20185\u2019 and removed the residual heat through RHRS (Residual Heat Removal System) and S\/G. The damage of the NSCW system pipes was appeared to be due to the disconnection of some steel wires caused by the long-term corrosion of the internal cylinder and steel wires, as the pipes were established inside of the concrete gallery that can be easily corroded. The licensee covered the NSCW system with temporary plate for prompt recovery, and replaced the pipes damaged during an overhaul and the neighboring pipes that cracking was detected. Also, in the long term, the licensee determined to strengthen the investigation on the NSCW system pipes and the concrete gallery and to perform minute investigation on the cracking or leakage of the NSCW system pipes every 5 years.","563":"While performing an emergency trip logic test after high neutron flux low setpoint trip test at around 11:37 during normal operation, as not recognizing the situation that the reactor trip breaker was opened by the malfunction of Block Relay, the reactor trip bypass breaker was opened at 13:01 and it caused the reactor to trip. Usually, trip signal should be blocked when removing inhibition signal after a low setpoint trip test. However, as the trip signal was not blocked due to bad contact, the reactor trip breaker was opened as the inhibition signal was removed. Although the reactor trip breaker was opened at around 11:37, the operator neglected it for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, and overlooked the failed status of trip breaker status light. Also, he did not check the position of the trip breaker. In addition to it, it was confirmed that the management of related regular\/periodical test was inappropriate and the inspection on relays were insufficient. To prevent recurrence, the licensee strengthened the inspection procedure on the block relay and complemented the test procedure. Also, he prepared a reactor trip breaker operation procedure and improved the operation procedures for principle components.","564":"Effort was in progress to repair the faulty pressure gauge of the main safety valve (MSV)  of the primary circuit. In the course of this activity 2 MSVs out of 12 opened, and the steam was received by the accident isolation system as designed. Partial steam release to environment occurred through the clean air venting facility of the isolation system decay chamber without exceeding permissible limits. Once personnel activated the lines of forced closure, the above two valves closed. Repair of the faulty pressure gauge was performed -  without the established work program, combined with the failure to take technical measures aimed at preventing unauthorized opening of MSVs.","565":"While connecting diesel generator (DG)-5 to essential bus during routine test the bus section was deenergized. This caused the stop of turbo-generator (TG)-2 lub-oil system pump fed by this bus. Due to defect in the standby feature activation system the standby oil pump failed to start. A signal of oil tank level and oil pump discharge pressure decrease was formed and TG-2 was tripped by protection system. Reactor power was reduced to 50% by TG trip protection. The cause of bus failure was wrong connection of DG-5 power cable to the bus after maintenance.\nBASIS FOR RATING: Initiator - essential bus deenergization. Event expected, real. Safety function availability within safe operation limits and conditions, which corresponds to level 1\/2 (B-1R).

Operating personnel has identified the failure to control the valve at the discharge side of the High Pressure System (HPSI) pump due to a disconnected power cable of the above valve. The deficiency was eleminated and valve operability check was performed. One day later at 11.40 inoperability of all three HPSI system trains were eliminated without reducing the unit power. Disconnection of power cables from HPSI pump valve motors was performed on 04.02.91 after unit shutdown in the course of cooldown process to avoid reactor vessel water hammer effect in cold condition at possible unauthorized start of these pumps. However, due to deficiencies in the work and surveillance program and in the design as regards valve position monitoring from the control room, the power supply was incompletely restored and this ocurrence was not discovered during the prestart testing. Breach of unit safe operation condition occurred as regards the number of operable HPSI system trains.","568":"The unit was in maintenance. At 19:35, while performing the reactor cooldown effort, a coolant leak from a NB50 pipeline of the primary water makeup system into the sealed rooms occurred. At 21:03 the leak was stopped by isolating the affected pipeline. The leak from the pipeline was isolated under the normal design configuration. Radiation situation in the attended rooms, on-site and off-site remained unchanged. Activity releases through the vent stack above limits prescribed for normal operation did not occur.","569":"As a result of a tornado the 330, 154 and 110 kV transmission lines were damaged. At 02:27 and 02:32 turbogenerator 1 and 2 were tripped by system emergency protection as a result of strong frequency oscillations in the system. At 02:32 reactor shutdown upon AZ-1 signal, actuated on core pressure difference increase above setpoint because of increased flowrate of the Reactor Coolant Pumps as a result of grid frequency rise up to. The normal Diesel Generators (DGs) 1,2 and the standby diesel (SD) started for coast down as designed. Since the auxiliary power buses were under voltage, DGs 1,2 tripped after 1.5 mins of operation according to design algorithm. Personnel transferred DGs 1,2 and SD to manual control and auxiliary power was supplied from service transformers. Main steam header pressure maintaining and residual heat removal were performed using turbine bypass check valves (venting steam to condensers) and steam dump valves (controlled bleed to station service collector). Steam generator (SG) levels were nominal. Preparations were started to bring the reactor to the minimum controlled power level. At 03:33 AZ-1 signal was formed again. DGs 1,2 and SD failed to start due to their unavailability for the start-up (they were on manual control). Significant voltage oscillatios at 6 kV auxiliary buses subsequently followed. By 04:00 the primary cause of the AZ-1 scram signal was eliminated; DGs 1,2 and SD were brought to automatic control. At 04:11 at voltage decrease AZ-1 signal was formed on Reactor Protection System (RPS) feeders deenergization. DGs 1,2 and SD started. DGs 1,2 failed to get connected to essential buses since the latter were under voltage and after 1.5 mins of operating tripped. Since the AZ-1 signal for DGs start persisted, DGs 1,2 periodic restarts followed which led to exhausting the air inventory in the DGs startup air bottles. Core cooling was maintained through natural circulation. The SD remained in service at coast down but at 04:26 was tripped by the oil pressure protection. Subsequent attempts to supply power to auxiliary buses from the DGs were unsuccessful due to absence of air in the startup bottles. At 06:15 as a result of system accident progression total loss of power occurred. DGs 1,2 and SD failed to start due to insufficient air pressure in the DG startup air bottles. The vital buses were connected via the reversible motor generators to the batteries. Core cooldown was performed via SGs in the natural circulation mode with steam dumping. At 06:45 unit power supply from the off-site source was restored. Throughout the transient core status was being monitored with the help of design-provided (normal) instrumentation.","570":"The unit was at 3% of thermal nominal power with turbogenerator (TG)-2 at coast down and TG-1 under maintenance. A short circuit occurred in the armature winding of the reversible motor generator (RMG-1) connected to the unit DC panel (UDCP-1). Automatic breaker which disconnects UDCP-1 from RMG-1 failed to open. The resulting current oscillations have led to the opening of the automatic breaker which supplies power to Reactor Protection System (RPS) emergency protections panels from UDCP-1. The automatic breaker of the same panels fed from the common unit DC panel opened on unexplained cause. Because of loss of voltage on the RPS panel AZ-1 protection actuated and the reactor was scrammed. The signal for diesel generators (DG) start was generated. The prestart oil circulation pumps (POCP) of these diesels fed from UDCP-1 started. Because of the total short circuit current in RMG-1 generator and the load current including the POCP starting currents, the automatic breaker connecting UDCP-1 to the battery opened. The automatic breaker feeding UDCP from RMG-1 was opened manually. As a result of UDCP deenergization operating DC supply to control circuits of some mechanisms without standby sypply from other DC panels was lost. This resulted in the failure to start two service DGs and one standby DG, loss of remote control function of safety injection pumps, emergency feedwater pumps, SG safety valve and normal operation systems mechanisms. 20 mins later the power to UDCP-1 was supplied through the mutual redundancy grid from the common unit DC panel. Reactor parameters remained under control and within safe operation limits. No on-site or off-site impacts.","571":"During the routine test of the 3QW (?) diesel generator (DG), the failure of its control system occurred. The DG was taken out of service for maintenance. 5 hours 41 minutes after the event the affected DG was tested under load and placed in expectation mode. While taking the affected DG out of service for repair personnel failed to test the two remaining safety system (SS) trains, which constitutes a breach of technological procedure requirements.\nBASIS FOR RATING: Initial event -failure of one SS train. Event - expected, postulated. Safety function availability - sufficient, which correponds to level 1\/2 (C-1P). The event reveals safety culture deficiencies (item 4.2 b), therefore level 2 has been chosen.","572":"During normal operation, the reactor was tripped by reactor protection signal (RCS flow low).    Upon investigation, it was identified that 1) ground fault occurred at the surge protector of RCP (reactor coolant pump) \u2018B\u2019, 2) main breaker and back-up breaker were tripped by actuation of the ground relay, 3) the RCP was tripped, 4) the RCS flow low signal was generated, 5) the reactor was tripped.","573":"During reactor coolant system (RCS) depressurization and cooldown after reactor manual shutdown, safety injection (SI) occurred by main steam line low pressure signal at S\/G \u2018C\u2019. \n Upon investigation, during the RCS depressurization and cooldown, main steam was over-released to condenser by main control room operator and main steam line pressure decreased quickly due to excessive cooldown of RCS. After stop of steam release to condenser, RCS cooldown and main steam line pressure decrease was still continued through S\/G blowdown. But, because of insufficient monitoring of operating parameter, main steam line pressure decreased to low pressure set-point and SI occurred. 23.7 tons of coolant was injected to RCS by SI, but it was verified that the fast cooling effect was negligible in terms of the thermal stress and fatigue. In the process of SI, pressurizer relief tank (PRT) rupture disk burst and 2.3 tons of coolant was spilled over to the reactor containment sump.  \n\nCauses and Corrective Actions \n The event was caused by operator\u2019s error not observing cooldown procedure. \n The following corrective actions were implemented. \n - Replacement of PRT rupture disc","574":"During power ascension after recriticality, licensee shutdown reactor manually for inspection on foreign material alarm of loose part monitoring system in feedwater-side of S\/G \u2018A\u2019. \n Upon investigation, a circle object (diameter: 40mm, height: 21mm, weight: 152.4g) was found in annular space of S\/G hot leg. It was verified that the object was magnetic fixing material which was used to fix lighting during the replacement of S\/G moisture separator in 2011 overhaul and it was not removed after the work. \n\nCauses and Corrective Actions \n The following corrective actions were implemented. \n - Inspection on S\/G \u2018A\u2019 tube with eddy current examination  \n - Foreign material inclusion inspection in all S\/Gs (A, B, C)  \n - Designation of chief manager at important area and management reinforcement of take-in and out item lists for foreign material inclusion prevention","575":"The bus protection relay was actuated by human error while survey on 13.8kV bus in the turbine building during overhaul in Kori Unit-3. At the time of survey, one of two off-site power bus was energized for surveillance of switch yard PCB.  Low voltage signal on the safety buses in Kori Unit-3 and 4 due to the loss of off-site power on the 4.16kV safety bus caused by ground fault which occurred due to the confusion of maintenance personnel for the equipment.  As a result, the emergency diesel generators started up and supplied power on the safety buses except EDG A in Kori Unit 4 that started manually 6 min. later due to the failure of control power. During the transient of power grid, Kori Unit-3, Unit-4 under overhaul and power operation had some effects such as pump stop and start, Two Units were maintained stable condition and normal power operation.","576":"Experienced a reactor trip due to the Reactor Coolant Pump trip.  Upon the investigation, it was identified that the RCPs tripped due to the actuation of the differential protective relay caused by the ground fault on the 345kV power grid between Shin-Ulsan and Kori Unit-2 swichyard. According to the results of survey on the faulted power grid, An foreign material(vinyl for vinyl house) was found which initiated power transients on the grid.   \nAlso investigation team evaluated some setpoint errors caused by miscalculation of actuation setpoint for reverse power relay of the generator circuit breaker which designed to open breaker during power transfer from on-site power to off-site power. \n\nCauses and Corrective Actions  \nlicensee had performed a detailed causes analysis, test and maintenance for affected parts \nThe following corrective actions were implemented. \n - Evaluated setpoint of the reverse power relay for generator protection \n - Performed functional test for reverse power relay \n - Reinforcement on design change and setpoint control \n - Enforcement of operational experience system \n\nSafety Assessment \n\nThere was no problem with the nuclear safety.

The reactor reached critical at 00:15 on November 17. At the reactor power of 2%, the operator was trying to test turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump. The operator should have manually operated the flow control valve that supplies steam to the pump for the test but he pushed on steam generator level low-low signal button instead to open the flow control valve without blocking the reactor trip. Temporary investigation showed the operator didn't realize the reactor already reached critical. The reactor tripped at 20:43 on the same day. The plant is returning to normal operation and there was no impact on reactor safety.","578":"There was a loss of reactor heat removal (RHR) while at midloop during refuelling. Due to an instrument error, there was a false low-low level signal generated from the reactor water storage tank (RWST), and, as a consequence, the signal transferred the suction supply to the containment sump (which, of course, was dry at this time). The operating RHR pump failed due to loss of suction supply. The primary system increased in temperature by 95 C, there was steaming from the primary system; a number of actionswere  taken by the operating staff; RHR was off for about one hour.","579":"Loss of suction to the pumps of the heat removal system (RHR) during the reactor cooling system (RCS) draining operation. The RHR was off for about 40 minutes, until level was restored by draining from the storage tank (RWST). Primary temperatures rose to almost the boiling point.","580":"During refuelling outage, the fuel loading of the reactor was completed and the concentration of H3BO3 in the primary circuit was 12g\/l. During the decontamination of secondary side of steam generator 3 by chemical solution a rupture of the blow-down pipe occurred and part of the solution was spilled in the steam generator compartment. The solution then reached the emergency boron tank and polluted it with chemical products. On 20-21 May the tank was drained, cleaned and filled again with concentration of H3BO3 equal to 12 g\/l. During the drainage and cleaning of the tank three additional lines were assured for delivery of boron solution to the primary circuit and to the spent fuel pool, if necessary. Also measures were taken to prevent possible penetration of clean water to the reactor and spent fuel pool. Nevertheless the operation was outside operational limits and conditions because the emergency boron tank was not available.\nDuring the week 22 (25-29 May 1998) the event was investigated by the Bulgarian Nuclear Safety Authority (BNSA). The cases for the SG blow-down pipe rupture are still not clearly identified. Additional control of all similar pipes of all SG's of WWER-440 units at Kozloduy NPP was required by the BNSA.\nThe event was preliminarily rated at level 1 according to the Section III-3.2 of the INES user's manual. After the event investigation the INES level was increased by BNSA to level 2 due to deficiencies of safety culture violation of procedures without justification (Section III-5.3).","581":"While the reactor was increasing power following inspection and repairing of small leaks in the main steam tunnel, there was an automatic shutdown caused by a failure of the main control personnel to control reactor pressure. During recovery actions, it was found that the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling  (RCIC) system was inoperative. Investigation of the incident revealed that the RCIC system had been inoperative for at least a year, because of deficiencies in the surveillance procedures and failure of main control room personnel to detect this condition when this system was required while executing routine activities in July 2001.","582":"While performing refuelling, at the time of unloading the core and lifting a spent fuel assembly, a failure occurred affecting the refuelling machine which caused the spent fuel assembly to slump to the reactor core. The fuel assembly was taken to a safe condition. Reactor vessel water and refuelling floor atmosphere were monitored without finding any abnormal changes.","583":"Feedwater pipe rupture during starting up of a feedwater pump. After the pipe rupture, the leakage was rapidly isolated and the operating feedwater pumps stopped. The water levels of the steam generators were controlled by the auxiliary feedwater pumps which started automatically.The pipe rupture occurred at the turbine hall; a few cubic meters of non-radioactive water flowed on the floor of the turbine hall. The reactor was manually tripped before initiation by the automatic protection system. Thereafter, the unit was immediately brought to a stable shutdown condition, and preparations to bring the reactor to a cold shut down condition were started by borating the primary circuit.","584":"One pipe of the feedwater system of Loviisa 1 broke. The ruptured tube was situated in the turbine hall of the unit. Water and steam flew into the turbine hall. The operation of the Unit was stopped by a manual reactor scram immediately after trip of all feedwater pumps. Both auxiliary feedwater pumps started as planned and the transient in the steam generator level was small. The leak was isolated in about twenty minutes. The local damages to nearby cables and smaller pipelines were significant but no important functions were lost besides the main feedwater system. The leaked water and steam did not include radioactive nuclides. The incident did not endanger the radiation safety at the plant or the environment, and no persons were injured. Investigations have indicated that the wall thickness of the ruptured pipe has been decreased due to erosion corrosion. Also in other four feedwater pipelines at the unit no. 1 as well as in four corresponding lines at the unit no. 2, the erosion corrosion had caused some decrease in the wall thickness.","585":"An earthquake of magnitude 9.1 occurred off the western coast of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean and generated a transoceanic tsunami which devastated the coastline, with a maximum runup of 50.9 m on the northwest coast of Sumatra. When the tsunami struck the plant in India, the condenser cooling pumps were affected due to flooding of the pump house and subsequent submerging of the seawater pumps. Following this, the reactor tripped automatically and the reactor was brought to cold shutdown using the emergency operating procedure. The pump house operating floor is located about 2.5 m above mean sea level, about 2m below the level of the main plant buildings, and is connected by a submarine tunnel about half a kilometre long to the intake well. The increase in water level in the pump house during the tsunami rendered all the seawater pumps located in this area inoperable except for one process seawater pump. This pump was used to cool the NPP\u2019s loads in the initial period following reactor shutdown. Later, this pump also became unserviceable due to clogging of the travelling water screen in the seawater pump house due to the ingress of large quantities of debris from the tsunami. Though off-site power remained available throughout the event, emergency diesel generators were started and were kept running as a precautionary measure. The plant declared an emergency alert at 10:25 on 26 December 2004, which was lifted at 21:43 on 27 December 2004. The tsunami did not affect Unit 2, which was under long shut down. After restoration of the affected areas, the unit was restarted on 1 January 2005. This event showed that external flooding (in particular from tsunamis) can lead to the loss of the ultimate heat sink and create further common cause failures if the flooding level is above the design basis flood. Moreover, it showed that external events can affect simultaneously several units at the same site, and can bring additional issues when the infrastructure is destroyed.","586":"Following the first phase of the hot functional testing, an inspection of the reactor coolant system revealed extensive damage to the tube ends and to the tube-sheet welds in the upper head of one of the two steam generators. Cause was found to be loose parts from failed reactor-vessel internal components (in-core instrument nozzels). Of the 52 nozzles, 21 had broken off and 14 had cracks in the region of the weld. In addition, 4 in-core instrument-guide-tube extensions were broken and 4 were cracked. The remaining 44 extensions were intact. Examination revealed that, in addition to the damaged tube ends and tube-sheet welds, the inside surface of the steam generator head had nicks and scratches.","587":"A fire ignited in switchgear building resulted in a loss of off-site power and reactor scram. All four diesel generators started as planned and all safety features functioned normally. The unit was 8.5 hours without off-site power. The event did not cause any radiation doses or radioactive releases.","588":"During periodic testing it was recognised that the core spray pumps were disconnected; the failure was remedied in ten minutes. Two weeks earlier, prior to start up after refuelling, all systems were checked and found o.k.. However, later an additional test was performed when the disconnectors to the pumps were opened and remained so.","589":"Criticality shut down margin experiment started without hydraulic scram system being operable","590":"On 20 August at 02:30 tests of the modified turbine controller were being carried out and for this reason three out of six main coolant pumps were switched off. Reloading of the reactor and the turbines occurred as expected. At 02:33 unexpected level increase in one of the six steam generators (SG) was observed. The level increase continued though the level interlock actuated properly and operator action was carried out. At 02:37 unit protection on high SG level actuated that caused the trip of both operating turbines. During the reactor protection actuation sticking of one of the 37 control rods was identified in a position about 25-50 cm from the upper end position. The parameters of the reactor were stabilized. The cause of the SG level increase has not yet been identified; for defining the causes of the control rod sticking elaboration of a programme was started. Cooling down of the reactor was initiated. On 7 August 1997 sticking of the same control rod was identified during starting the reactor after annual outage. That time the sticking was eliminated with repeated operation of the rod. During additional tests of the affected rod the failure did not reoccur, the reactor was restarted.","591":"Refuelling of Unit 4 was commenced on 18 June 1988. Operating personnel performed a planned switchover to natural circulation from loops 4 and 6 to loops 1 and 3 on 30 June. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of core cooling by natural circulation decreased sharply for about a 3 hour period. After switching over the natural circulation among the llps, the operating personnel isolated loops 4 and 6 and started to drain them. Nitrogen used to drain the water got into the loops in operation and most of the water was pushed from the SG primary side into the reactor vessel. The operator tried to stop disturbance of natural circulation by starting periodically the make-up pump to the working loops. During this injection the personnel performed venting several times to take away the gas-air mixture from the top of SG headers, Eventually, restoration of natural circulation was achieved by continuous venting of the SG headers.","592":"A periodic test of the steam generator auxiliary feedwater system, combined with the presence of a steam valve which had failed to close fully, brought about a hence overrapid cooling of the reactor coolant system. The operator took immediate action to bring the reactor back to zero power and decided to inhibit the safety injection automatic triggering devices and the steam isolation devices, which he deemed to be useless in the circumstances.","593":"An inspector of the regulatory body detected that filters of the water sump on the containment building were not properly installed to prevent safety pumps from sucking debris. This system is expected to (re-)inject cooling water to the reactor core after a major rupture of primary piping. All the 1300 MW(e) reactors are at present being brought into line with accepted standards.","594":"All eight reactor units at Pickering A and B experienced a total loss of the on-site electric power, caused by a blackout that affected the electric grid supplying the Province of Ontario, Canada, and parts of the US. At the time of the event, Pickering A had units 1, 2 and 3 in the guaranteed shutdown state and unit 4 running at 12% of full power but not synchronized to the grid. Pickering B station had units 5, 6 and 8 operating at full power while unit 7 was heating up as it returned to service from a planned outage.\nAll operating units were safely shutdown. However, for a period of approximately 5.5 hours, immediately following the blackout, cooling of the reactor units was achieved only by natural circulation. Additionally, the High Pressure Emergency Coolant Injection (HPECI) System (common to all units) which is required to protect the hot-shutdown or operating units against accidents, if certain failures were to occur, was impaired. Units in the guaranteed shutdown state did not require the protection of the HPECI System. Another back-up heat sink, the Shutdown Cooling System, was also unavailable for 3 hours.  At all times, on all units, reactor power was controlled, fuel was adequately cooled and containment was available.","595":"The reactor was shutdown on 29-09 to inspect the secondary side of Boiler #3 to determine the cause of level disturbance anomalies. Entry to the affected boiler  into the area of the Emergency Water Supply\/Reheater Drains Distribution Header was made on 04-10. During the inspection, it was discovered that the header had severe erosion\/corrosion damage. Through wall holes in the header were found at the tee connection, and the sleeve connection at the shroud was displaced and damaged. Consequently, a decision was made to inspect the headers in all boilers and similar damage was found in each boiler. The headers in all boilers were removed and replaced with an erosion\/corrosion resistant material. It was subsequently assessed that the boilers were fit for service as no other damage affecting structural integrity was observed. The defective headers were assessed as not being related to the boiler level indication anomalies. Following completion of this work the reactor was returned to operation.","596":"During routine calibration of the Regional Overpower (ROP) detectors for Shutdown System 1 and 2, an incorrect calibration factor was applied. The calibration factor used was applicable for operation at 96%, however, the reactor was at 100% full power. This error in calibration was discovered approximately six hours later at which time all detectors were recalibrated to the correct value. The calibration error was in the unsafe direction, therefore, the rip effectiveness on this parameter for both shutdown systems was reduced for the period which the incorrect calibration existed.","597":"During start-up procedures while the reactor temperatures were still far below operational values it was detected that the valves at the containment spray pump' suction were closed in contrary with their required open position. The testing instructions were not clear. A similar event occurred recently at unit 2.","598":"A scram occurred due to a failure of a condensate pump. Analyses of the pressure versus time charts shows that during a few minutes the secondary pressure reached almost 110% of the permitted value. It is therefore questionable whether the valves pressure release function is fulfilling specifications. A reason for the failure is that the conversion factor from compressed air to steam was erroneously calculated, corresponding to less than 10% higher opening pressure (valid also for Ringhals 3 and 4).","599":"Workman turned on an emergency oil pump, powered by the dc supply, for a weekly 2-hr test run and then forgot to turn it off.  About 4 hr after the oil pump had been turned on, the reactor scrammed. However, by this time the voltage from the dc electrical supply system had become too low, which caused several auxiliary electrical circuits to fail. All eight turbine and generator bearings suffered some damage. Primary-coolant-pump shaft warped and had to be replaced. Two months to repair damage. No injuries and no radioactivity released.","600":"Inadvertent Containment Spray of Reactor Coolant. licensed by the Government (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology) on May 19, 2010, under power ascension test at 50% power, was manually shutdown on September 14,  2010 to re-adjust the ex-core detector position. After completion of the maintenance for the ex-core  detector, the plant restarted the heat-up operation controlling the reactor coolant temperature utilizing  the shutdown cooling system; the plant was on mode 4 with the RCS pressure and temperature was  28kg\/cm2 and 145\u2103, respectively. Both the shutdown cooling system and the containment spray system  share the shutdown heat exchanger and are separated by the heat exchanger outlet isolation valve (CSV033)  and the containment spray isolation valve (CS-V035). CS-V033 was opened and CS-V035 was  closed when the incident occurred. \nOn September 17, at 14:17, the CS-V035 opened inadvertently due to a human error, and reactor  coolant was sprayed into the containment through the containment spray system. The RCS experienced  a severe transient; the pressure was decreased rapidly from 28kg\/cm2 to 3.9kg\/cm2  and the temperature  and water level were lowered quickly. \nRapid decrease of RCS pressure and water level was identified by the MCR operators, and the  operators carried out responsive actions in accordance with the emergency operating procedure (EOP)  including stop of reactor coolant pumps (RCPs), isolation of the letdown line, and increasing the charging flow. Also, additional safety measures were taken; manual actuation of the safety injection to recover the RCS inventory, and manual actuation of containment isolation to prevent radioactive material release to the environment. \nAfter taking a series of initial responses, MCR operators identified that the containment spray isolation valve (CS-V035) was abnormally opened; the valve was manually closed at 14:54 and the plant entered into stable condition. The result of analyses based on the changes of refueling water tank  (RWT) level and RCS inventory showed that the amount of the sprayed water (or borated water) to the containment was 423 tons. \nDuring the event progression, major plant safety systems including the emergency diesel generator (EDG) and containment purge isolation were actuated as designed. As a result of the event, most of the Structures, Systems, Components (SSCs) inside the containment were affected by the sprayed borated water; especially the reactor cavity and the containment floor level were flooded. \nAs the operating parameters such as leakage rate of reactor coolant was within the emergency issuance condition, the plant declared emergency (Alert level) at 15:00, and cleared at 18:00 after confirming the plant operating conditions. ","601":"On completion of unit preventive maintenance testing and adjustment of Main Safety Valves (MSVs) was in progress. Four MSVs have been tested in turn, and only one pilot valve (PV) functioned as designed. The remaining PVs failed to completely close (remotely) and were giving oil steam. This led to pressure increase in the sealed rooms up to the setpoint of AZ-5 emergency protection actuation and a maximum design-basis accidentv (MDBA) signal was formed  in the protection systems logic. Group 1 hydrovolumes of Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) were activated. The mechanisms of ECCS subsystems 1,2 and 3 failed to adequately respond to the design algorithm. 7 mins. after the MDBA signal was formed in the 2nd set of protections logic, the same signal was generated in the 1st set. The mechanisms of ECCS subsystem 1 started and functioned according to the design algorithm while ECCS subsystems 2 and 3 failed to respond. Subsequently the primary circuit was being cooled down by personnel at a rate specified by procedure.\n\nSafety function availability - adequate.","602":"While testing automatic activation of 6 kV auxiliary power bus standby source of Unit 1 which was in maintenance and due to switching overvoltages, standby boiler's 6 kV cable insulation was damaged resulting in cable short-circuiting and burning. This resulted in the damage to Unit 2 cables laid nearby, deenergizing of two 6 kV auxiliary power buses, loss of power to two reactor coolant pumps causing the actuation of reactor scram. Breach of safe operation limits and conditions did not occur. Radiation situation remained normal. No injuries occurred while extinguishing the fire.\nIntitial event - cable burning. Event expected, real. Safety function availability: full. Table 1: A-1R - level 0\/1. It was found that the non-design cable was used. Units 1 and 2 cables were laid together which constitutes violation of procedure, therefore level 1 has been chosen.","603":"During the planned outage, refuelling is in progress. After loading a fresh assembly into the core, refuelling machine (RM) operator pulled out RM beam from the reactor and started to relocate RM to spent fuel pool area in order to take the next fresh fuel assembly. While RM was moving, personnel heard unusual noise and stopped RM. A damaged fresh fuel assembly was found on RM beam in spite of the fact that according to all instrumentation readings, the assembly had been left in the core. The damaged fuel assembly was removed out of RM, no personnel overexposure and radioactive releases occurred.","604":"During the routine walkdown the operating staff registered not authentic readings of the steam generator no. 3 level controller connected to the emergency protection system circuit. Safety operation conditions of the Technical Specifications which allow corrective measures within 8 hours were violated, actually the defect has been eliminated in 14 hours.","605":"Unit was restarted after planned maintenance and was gaining power. At the power level of 450 MWe (at 7:52 a.m.) the reactor was shut down by the emergency protective system on neutron flux level actuation. The actuating signal had been formed as a result of a defect in the reactor neutron flux control system elements. During the transient process, because of the failure of the fast-acting isolating valves of the steam pipe (protective systems affecting valves were not in preparedness state), there was a pressure drop in the steam generators and of the level in the pressurizer lower than the prescribed limits for safe operation.","606":"Safety System (SS) train 3 diesel generator (DG) started on 6 kV bus deenergization. This was followed by DG trip by the maximum current protection of its excitation system. After connecting the essential bus to the service bus and following unsuccessful attempt to start the service water pumps for essential consumers damage to manway hatch of the service water system was discovered. The essential bus deenergiztion was caused by the short circuit in the \"redundant complex\" cable provided for by initial design and later disconnected from one end only. SS trains 1 and 2 testing was performed on time. 16 hours 55 min later SS train 3 was successfully tested with sequential loading. During the event the unit was operating at 760 MWe power. \nBASIS FOR RATING: Initiator - expected, real (essential bus deenergization). Safety function availability - within limits and conditions. According to Table A2 - level 1\/2 (B-1R). Level 2 has been chosen since the event reveals safety culture deficiencies.","607":"Inspections during the maintenance and refueling shutdown revealed more than 200 metallurgical defects, not complying with the construciton rules, on the main steam pipes of the secondary system of the installation.","608":"Operator noted a reduction of water flow from one of the primary coolant pumps, accompanied by excessive vibration in the same pump. He initiated a controlled shutdown of the reactor. When the power level had dropped to 40% of power, an automatic scram was set off by the complete loss of flow from the pump as the pump shaft had broken. An examination revealed that the break had occurred at a place where the shaft diameter was reduced. The radius machined in this area was too small, resulting in excess stress. The shafts of all main reactor coolant pumps were replaced with shafts of a different design, and the reactor was returned to service.","609":"Inadequate protection relays and related setpoints. During periodic testing of the diesel generators automatic load sequence, it was discovered that the 380V safety related equipments were not energized as expected. The reason for that failure is that a protection relay had an unexpected high voltage trip value that was not appropriately adjusted. The setpoint was too low so that, when the diesel generator was supplying the 380 V board, the protection tripped on high voltage de-energizing power supply to safety related equipments. At the same time, it was discovered that the low voltage setpoint was not adjusted as by the design specification and that it was not possible to reach the right value due to construction features of the protection relay. Some of these safety related 380 V boards were replaced during the last plant outage in April 2005 and all the new boards had the same problem, having the same inadequate protection relay. The consequence was that some of the safety related equipments were not available in two out of three safety related trains in case of loss of off-site power supply. The same problem was also present in one train of the second level protection systems (plant protection against external events). After identification of the problem the license immediately re-adjusted the high voltage setpoint to a higher value. The adjustment of the low voltage setpoint is under investigation.","610":"Four successive events (error in piping alignment, valve position and pump operation, Emergency Core Cooling System unavailability) occurred between 21 and 24 November  during restart stages. These incidents are mainly relying on human and organisational factors. Each of these events would be rated, at the most, at level 1 on the INES scale. However, their accumulation within a very short period, significant of a collective lack of rigor, led the Nuclear Safety Authority to rate the last of them at level 2 on the INES Scale.","611":"The sand filters installed in 1988 to decrease pressure within containment buildings in case of a hypothetical severe accident were found to have been inoperable for one year due to abnormal presence of plugs in the pipes leading to the sand filters shared by the two units.","612":"During staff investigation of a minor event the staff detected a design error in the level instrumentation in the annulus between the sphere and the containment building, affecting 3 out of 4 sumps. This error, deficiency in 3 sumps, would have affected the actuation of Residual Heat Removal System (RHR) during a small LOCA, in the recirculation phase and would have resulted in inadequate safety function. This deficiency has been present since the start-up of the plant. The error has been corrected and the plant is operating at full power.","613":"Significant unexpected erosion of main feedwater(MFW) lines caused by flow accelerated corrosion (FAC); degradation of those was discovered by the licensee in at least two areas of the straight sections of ASME Class 2 safety\u00adrelated MFW piping inside containment. The thinning was discovered when the Trojan steam piping inspection program was expanded to include single\u00adphase piping. The thinning was attributed to high fluid flow velocities and other operating factors.","614":"Hurricane Andrew passed directly over the two-unit nuclear power station just south of Miami with a sustained wind speed of 145 mph and gusts of at least 175 mph. The plant lost all offsite power during the storm and the following five days. Emergency diesel generators provided onsite power and maintained the plant during recovery operations until offsite power was restored 6 days later. All offsite communications were lost for 4-hours during the storm and access to the site was blocked by debris and fallen trees. The nuclear power station\u2019s fire protection system was destroyed when winds and wind-generated missiles toppled a tower supporting a water storage tank containing 100,000 gallons of water used for fire fighting; fire suppression system was declared inoperable prompting a station \u201cAlert\u201d to be declared. Following the storm, pumps and hoses were deployed to a near-by salt water lagoon to compensate for the loss of the fire suppression system. The nuclear\npower station is one of the few US reactors with electrical power cables used for shutting down the reactor installed on the exterior of the reactor containment buildings. These cable trays and conduits were coated with a fire-resistant material. The hurricane forcewinds stripped much of the fire resistant coating off these exterior applications exposing the reactor shutdown cabling to any subsequent fire. The wind blew the combustible fuel from the two adjacent oil fired plants over the nuclear site as well as an oil slick over the lagoon later designated the source for backup fire suppression water inventory. Fortunately the fuel oil did not ignite with the passing storm.","615":"During hot functional testing (prior to fuel loading and start of operation), three of four safety valves suddenly separated from two headers of a main steam line in the secondary system. Substantial rule changes were adopted as a result of this incident. The nuclear system was not involved in this incident; no release of radioactivity.","616":"With train A of the Emergency Service Water (ESW) in service, train B of the ESW was started up in order to proceed with the reparation of a check valve and replace a flow meter. At the impulsion side of train B an immediate drop of pressure was detected after the pump was started up, what led the crew to stop the pump and proceed to investigate the event. After checking it locally, a break was found in the hatch neck , located in a small chest after the pumps building. After reparation and restoring operability of train B, plant personnel proceeded to inspect train A of the ESW. Similar loss of thickness due to corrosion was found at the same hatch neck as the repaired one in train B and similar reparation was conducted in train A. The remaining hatch necks showed thickness within the engineering margins, although some of them presented corrosion points. Afterwards, it has been revealed that the utility was aware of the degradation of train A almost simultaneously to the degradation of train B since 1993 but maintenance activities had not been improved. In year 2000 no measures were taken after an inspection report had recommended an measure of the thickness of the affected hatch neck. May, the 10th 2004 percolated dampness was identified and the utility did not declare the correspondent \u201cnon-compliance\u201d status of the plant.","617":"With the unit shut down and reactor coolant system (RCS) at 146 C and 2,413 kPa, plant operators were preapring to place one train of shutdown cooling into service. When they opened the motor-operated suction valve for the \"B\" low pressure safety injection pump, indicated pressurizer level decreased from 35% to offscale low, and RCS pressure decreased to 689 kPa. Operators closed the pump suction valve to terminate the coolant loss, and tripped the operating reactor coolant pumps due to low RCS pressure. Approximately 20,818 litres of coolant flowed from the RCS to the refueling water storage pool. Pressurizer level was restored after operators manually started one of the high pressure safety injection pumps. The licensee declared an ALERT emergency classification due to this event.","618":"During an overhaul, a fine crack was found at the pipe junction on the pressurizer side of the steam relief valve. Upon investigation, it was identified that thermal load was repeated by steam relief valve actuation in condition that connected pipe was stuck due to defective construction of supporting structure and, therefore, the crack was caused by corrosion fatigue crack at the weld.","619":"During the annual overhaul, while performing a surveillance test for the Current Transformer (CT) of the main generator on September 3, 2009, Wolsong Unit 2 experienced a Loss of Voltage (LOV) at the safety bus due to opening of the switchyard breaker(Power Circuit Breaker 7300). The switchyard breaker was opened inadvertently due to spurious actuation of the \u2018reverse power relay (32A relay)\u2019. In response to the LOV, the Standby Diesel Generator (SDG) #2 started up automatically and the safety related equipments loaded from the SDG were actuated automatically and successfully as designed. However, the SDG #1 did not started up because it was under maintenance. The safety grade-4 power (13.8 kV) could be restored by closing the Power Circuit Breaker (PCB) 7300, 33 minutes after the LOV while implementing the Emergency Operating Procedure-015 (Loss of Grade-4 Power). \nUpon investigation, the reverse power relay was found to be actuated due to several factors such as 1) unanticipated performance of the circuit containing the protective relay (78 relay, out-of-stop relay) and the reverse power relay, 2) the plant operator\u2019s failure to confirm the plant initial condition for surveillance and 3) improper process control for the annual overhaul work. After the LOV which continued 17 seconds for the train-B and 33 minutes for the train- A, the SDG #2 automatically actuated and it supplied power to the train-B and the train-A power was restored by closing the PCB 7300. \nWhile restoring the LOV condition and implementing the EOP, there was no problem with the safety function and the plant was maintained in the guaranteed shutdown condition. \nCauses and Corrective Actions \nDuring the reconstruction test, it was found that an unanticipated 190 mV voltage for 78Ry and 108 mA current for 32A was generated in the circuit (Fig. 2) by opening and closing the \u2018knife switch\u2019 during measurement of the CT insulation resistance. And the unanticipated generatedcurrent again caused the protective relay (32A) to actuate of which the setpoint was 45 mA. According to the overhaul schedule, while performing the CT surveillance test, the PCB 7300 should be in open position, the main transformer should be in shutdown mode and the link (generator output breaker) should be disconnected from the generator. However, the PCB 7300 was in closed position and the main transformer was pressurized during the surveillance test. Accordingly, this event was attributed to spurious actuating of the 32A relay which the operators couldn\u2019t anticipated and the improper process control for the maintenance work. \nThe following corrective actions were implemented. \n- Revised the related surveillance and maintenance procedures \n- Improved the process control for the overhaul work \n- Planed to improve the Out-of-Stop Relay (long-term plan) \n\nSafety Assessment \n\nSafety related variables i.e., the reactor header inlet\/outlet temperatures, the moderator outlet temperature, the component cooling water (CCW) temperature and the spent fuel pool temperatures were checked in depth. And the reactor coolant system (RCS) subcooling was identified to be maintained, the CCW temperature was found to be increased from 25 \u2103 to 34 \u2103 which was below the limit value, 38 \u2103. There was no adverse effect on the plant safety or radioactive material release to the environment as a result of this event.","620":"During its 91.5% reactor power, the \"reactor containment box-up\" occurred which caused the 40 isolation valves of the reactor ventilation system to close. Upon investigation, the sequence of box-up event was like this; a fault sprinkler nozzle of the D\/G room adjacent to the \"secondary control area(SCA)\" discharged water, the sprinkled water penetrated inside the panel of the SCA and the water penetration into the SCA panel caused a spurious signal. As a result of the sprinkler nozzle failure in the #2 D\/G room and the sprinkled water, the radiation monitoring panel, the #2 D\/G panel and other panels in the SCA were partially submerged. The utility implemented a replacement of the damaged components with spare parts(radiation monitoring panel), integrity inspection(SCA panels) and disassembly inspection for the #2 D\/G. The reactor containment box-up signal from the SCA panel is different from the reactor trip signal and do not cause subsequent reactor trip or power reduction. Confirming the integrities of components and proper measures for the box-up signal, the box-up was cleared at 7:33 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005. During the box-up event, all plant safety systems operated as expected and there was no radiation release to the site nor to the environment.","621":"Opening of one of the four Coolant Liquid Release Valves in the Primary Heat Transport System (PHTS), due to its actuator failure, while the reactor was operating at full power. Heavy water in PHTS was released to the degasser condenser. The reactor automatically tripped on pressurizer low level about two minutes later. The turbine runback was initiated, and the operator manually tripped the turbine. Degasser condenser pressure control spray valves and level control valves were closed as designed. PHTS pressure recovered and stabilized with one liquid relief valve open. Operator action was focused on keeping the coolant inventory in the pressurizer and the feed pump suction head by pumping heavy water from the supply tank to the storage tank, while maintenance crew investigated the cause of the problem and the possibility of repairing the damaged liquid relief valve. The cooldown and the depressurization was not performed by the operator immediately. Degasser condenser pressure was built up due to heavy water inflow through the small line connected to the feed water pump discharge. This caused both degasser condenser relief valves to open and heavy water to spill onto the floor sump. Steaming of hot water caused reactor building isolation on reactor building pressure high signal for a few minutes. The operator cooled down the reactor and depressurized PHTS. During the event about 6.5 tonnes of heavy water were spilled. There was no notable radiation exposure and radioactivity release to the environment.","622":"One of the two air operated Liquid Relief Valves (LRV) on each of the two primary heat transfer (PHT) loops opened spuriously partially filling the degasser-condenser and initiating a small LOCA through the rupture discs of the heavy water storage tank (HWST). About 25 tonnes of heavy water (nearly 13 percent of core inventory) was lost from the PHT system during this event that was terminated 20 minutes later by replacing the fuse that was damaged before during checks by a control technician.","623":"The unit was shut down by operating personnel due to breach of normal operation condition, namely, the time of safety system (SS) train 3 diesel generator being removed from service in excess of that specified by procedure. DG-3 tripping occurred during routine test of SS train 3 components immediately after connection to the bus. The cause of DG-3 trip is breaker defect. During replacement of the DG's faulty breaker the subsitute breaker designed for transformer switchings was erroneously installed. The closure of this breaker resulted in the damage to DG-3 exciter.\nBASIS FOR RATING: Event - postulated, expected (failure of one SS train while routine testing). Safety funciton availability - adequate. According to Table A1 - level 1\/2 (C-1P). Level 2 has been chosen since the event revals safety culture deficiencies.","624":"During  replacement of generator exciter anchor, due to alignment errors at the special water treatment facility in the auxiliary building contaminated water got into the secondary circuit  (deaerators, etc.). Increased activity as compared to that specified in the procedure was detected only in deaerators and secondary side of the steam generator slightly above the authorized value - 2E-8 Ci\/l); radiation situation in the turbine building remained within background values. Radioactivity release to environment, contamination of the buildings, rooms and personnel overexposure did not occur.","625":"Spurious activation of fire extinguishing system occurred in one of the plant rooms. The water from the affected room penetrated to the lower room onto the Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) panels of Safety System (SS) - 1 which resulted in the actuation of that train. In the course of the load sequencing that followed, the valves on the discharge from the spray pump to containment room opened; then the spray pump was tripped by control key. Alarm indication showed the open steam generator-1 pilot valve (PORV). After unsuccessful attempt to close this valve using control key, the Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) -1 was tripped and the unit power was reduced to 67%. Due to water spilling onto the ESFAS cabinets the diesel generator-1 tripped and the essential bus was deenergized. The reactor was then brought to subcritical condition using the PZ-1 (emergency protection) button.","626":"Reactor Trip and Subsequent Steam Generator Dryout","627":"Loss of startup auxiliary transformer results in Unit 2 manual reactor protection system actuation.","628":"Failure of emergency diesel generator to start during a partial loss of offsite power due to faulty relay.","629":"Standby service water pump unavailable for 23 days.","630":"Reactor trip due to a degraded connection on a circuit board in the electro-hydraulic control cabinet.","631":"After a Residual Heat Removal Pump Seized, It Was Determined to Be Susceptible to Failure Since Being Overhauled in 1987","632":"Degraded control room fire barrier.","633":"Fouling of the cooling water systems due to concrete sealant injected into the service water tunnel","634":"2B Emergency Diesel Generator Inoperable Due to Slow Instrumentation Response","635":"Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feedwater Pump Operability Impacted by Incorrect Bearing.","636":"Unisolable reactor coolant system (RCS) leak","637":"Inadequate work instructions led to the loss of a 125-volt, direct-current train and subsequent reactor trip.","638":"Plant-centered LOOP, an emergency diesel generator unavailable and stuck open safety relief valve.","639":"Loss of Power to Safeguards Buses on Both Units","640":"Charging Pump Suction Valves from the RWST Potentially Unavailable Because of Pressure Locking","641":"Turbine-Driven Emergency Feedwater Pump Unavailable Because of a Mechanical Seal Failure","642":"Reactor trip due to loss of electrical bus and additional complications.","643":"Manual reactor scram due to leakage from the circulating water system and subsequent flooding of the condenser bay.","644":"The workers did not recognize that the vacuum cleaner lacked a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter and that it was dispersing airborne radioactivity into the containment building causing alarms on various monitors.

The pump was tested and requalified according to the technical specifications but the curve (flow-rate pressure) was not verified as required by ASME-XI. The actual flow rate delivered in case of specific accidents could no longer match the flow rate postulated in the safety report. Nevertheless, an independent emergency feedwater system could offer additional capacity in such circumstances. This anomaly was discovered on 18 march 2011 during a test which was suggested by the authorities.","660":"Operating at 43.2% of rated power in process for testing. While testing for the load rejection signal, the main turbine incremented its speed and main turbine control valves started to close. When the pressure at the first step started to decrease until 4.6 kg\/cm2, there was a main turbine trip signal due to the actuation of the Speed Acceleration Limiter, but this signal trip did not actuate the Reactor Primary System (RPS), instead there was a reactor trip due to high pressure signal of the reactor pressure vessel. The cause was that the during the power rising process after testing of the Moisture Separator Reheaters the alarms associated to the bypass of the signal trip for the main turbine trip were not reestablished, therefore the during approximately 40 minutes the reactor operated without this reactor trip signal.","661":"Ninety-two rods (less than 1% of rods) damaged were discovered during a refueling and 10-year inspection outage; the primary circuit was also highly contaminated. EdF proposed fretting due to rod vibration as reason while the origin of the vibration is still unknown.","662":"As part of a regular test, the operator of the Leibstadt nuclear power plant has found that two valves in the Special Emergency and Heat Removal System (SEHR) were in the wrong position. Instead of being throttled, they were closed.
